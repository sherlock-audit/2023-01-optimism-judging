# Balance between Gas saving and prudent checks needs another look

## Summary
We understand that Optimism wants users to be able to bridge their `ETH` at lowest Gas Fees possible . To bridge `ETH` , the function `depositTransaction` is anticipated to be used widely and probably the most called function signature .

But , we think there are some important checks missing , that will hamper the potential optimism users and their experience of bridging. 

Key checks that we consider to be added . 

1) `_gasLimit` does not have any minimum value check .
Consequence - If the `_gasLimit` is lower than minimum gas required to bridge , the `ETHER` bridged is effectively lost. 

2)  If `_isCreation` == false , there is no check to ensure  `_to` != address(0)
Consequence -: Users `ETHER` is burned .

        bytes memory _data
    ) public payable metered(_gasLimit) {
        // Just to be safe, make sure that people specify address(0) as the target when doing
        // contract creations.
        if (_isCreation) {
            require(
                _to == address(0),
                "OptimismPortal: must send to address(0) when creating a contract"
            );
        }
+      else{
+      require(_to != address(0), "ZERO_ADDRESS");
+      }
+      require(_gasLimit > MINIMUM_GAS_LIMIT);

        // Transform the from-address to its alias if the caller is a contract.
        address from = msg.sender;
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) {
            from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);
        }

        // Compute the opaque data that will be emitted as part of the TransactionDeposited event.
        // We use opaque data so that we can update the TransactionDeposited event in the future
        // without breaking the current interface.
        bytes memory opaqueData = abi.encodePacked(
            msg.value,
            _value,
            _gasLimit,
            _isCreation,
            _data
        );

        // Emit a TransactionDeposited event so that the rollup node can derive a deposit
        // transaction for this deposit.
