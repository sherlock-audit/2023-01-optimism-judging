# L1ERC721Bridge _initiateBridgeERC721 is not using safeTransferFrom. Necessary hooks and checks wouldn't be performed.

## Summary
L1ERC721Bridge _initiateBridgeERC721 is not using safeTransferFrom. Necessary hooks and checks wouldn't be performed.

## Vulnerability Detail
L1ERC721Bridge _initiateBridgeERC721 is not using safeTransferFrom.

## Impact

Necessary hooks and checks wouldn't be performed.

Necessary checks include
- Check whether target is an EOA.
- Check whether target is a contract that implement ERC721Receiver.
- Check whether target contract is accepting transfer with particular `_data` bytes.

If these checks fail, the transaction will be reverted. This is done to prevent the loss of NFT because of transferring into a contract that cannot receive ERC721.

Moreover, it won't perform onERC721Received hook.
