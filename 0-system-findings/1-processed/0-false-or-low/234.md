# `SELFDESTRUCT` will not work anymore after EIP-4758

## Summary

The burning of ETH on L2 will not work as expected when the `SELFDESTRUCT` op code is deactivated after the [EIP-4758](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4758) fork.

## Vulnerability Detail

The system uses the `selfdestruct` function to remove the ETH held by `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract to reduce the amount of ETH in the L2 circulating supply. However, after the [EIP-4758](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4758) fork, the `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode will be deactivated. Thus, the existing mechanism might not work as expected after the fork.

81:      *         ETH on L2 inflating when ETH is withdrawn. Currently only way to do this is to

83:      *         incentivized since this function is very cheap.

85:     function burn() external {
86:         uint256 balance = address(this).balance;

15:         new Burner{ value: _amount }();
16:     }
..SNIP..
32: /**

34:  * @notice Burner self-destructs on creation and sends all ETH to itself, removing all ETH given to
35:  *         the contract from the circulating supply. Self-destructing is the only way to remove ETH
36:  *         from the circulating supply.
37:  */
38: contract Burner {
39:     constructor() payable {
40:         selfdestruct(payable(address(this)));
41:     }
42: }
43: 
```

## Impact

The amount of ETH on L2 will be inflated when ETH is withdrawn from L2 as the ETH burning mechanism will not work as expected after the fork.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider another way of reducing the supply of ETH in L2 after withdrawal such as implementing the logic within the OVM.
