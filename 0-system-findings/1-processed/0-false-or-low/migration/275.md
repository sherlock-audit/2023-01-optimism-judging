  - **Description:** Legacy withdrawals can be immediately finalized after migration, even if they are less than 7 days old
  - **Reason:** This is not true. Rather legacy withdrawals will be subject to a 7 day finalization window even if they are more than 7 days old.

# Withdrawals in the 7 days prior to migration are immune to challenges, disabling the key defense mechanism of ORU

## Summary

The Bedrock migration involves implementing a new Genesis state, after which challenges for the pre-Bedrock period are not possible. Withdrawals that happen within 7 days of the migration will be saved in the new state, and therefore skip the necessary fraud proof period needed to keep an ORU secure.

## Vulnerability Detail

During migration, the sequencer performs state-surgery on the L2 state. It rewrites withdrawal data (including withdrawals triggered in the past 7 days) to a new format and resets the withdrawal window. From this point, all withdrawals proceed using the Bedrock method.

It can be observed that post Bedrock, all withdrawals of the past 7 days are no longer subject to fraud-proofs, disarming the key defensive component of the optimistic rollup. Users in effect are completely subject to the sequencer contrary to the way Optimism is presented. 

## Impact

Key defense mechanism of the Optimistic rollup is compromised during migration. Note that malicious sequencer is defined as in scope in the contest details page.
