# Incorrect Access Control on a external payable function

## Summary
A user can accidentally call the `donateETH()` payable function, without the ability to retrieve it.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Accepts ETH value without triggering a deposit to L2. This function mainly exists
     *         for the sake of the migration between the legacy Optimism system and Bedrock.
     */
    function donateETH() external payable {
        // Intentionally empty.
    }
```
>  This function mainly exists for the sake of the migration between the legacy Optimism system and Bedrock.

In this case, this function should be marked as only admins/owner access using a check/modifier.

## Impact
Lost of funds for the user.
