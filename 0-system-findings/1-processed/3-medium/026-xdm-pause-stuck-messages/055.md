# Pausing CrossDomainMessenger contract, which takes effect immediately, by its owner can unexpectedly block CrossDomainMessenger creator from calling relayMessage() function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The owner of the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract is able to call the pause function to pause this contract. When the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract is paused, calling the `relayMessage`  function that uses the `whenNotPaused` modifier reverts, and the `CrossDomainMessenger` creator is not able to get back any of the ETH amount, which was deposited by the creator previously.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L191-L193

                    ' function pause() external onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }'

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L256-343

                      'function relayMessage(
        uint256 _nonce,
        address _sender,
        address _target,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _minGasLimit,
        bytes calldata _message
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        (, uint16 version) = Encoding.decodeVersionedNonce(_nonce);
        require(
            version < 2,
            "CrossDomainMessenger: only version 0 or 1 messages are supported at this time"
        );

        // If the message is version 0, then it's a migrated legacy withdrawal. We therefore need
        // to check that the legacy version of the message has not already been relayed.
        if (version == 0) {
            bytes32 oldHash = Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0(_target, _sender, _message, _nonce);
            require(
                successfulMessages[oldHash] == false,
                "CrossDomainMessenger: legacy withdrawal already relayed"
            );
        }'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The pause function can be updated to be time-delayed so the 'CrossDomainMessenger' creator can have more time to react. One way would be to make this function only callable by a timelock governance contract.
