# NFTs will be frozen if receiver did not implement onERC721Received

## Summary

The bridge allows sending ERC721 tokens to non-EOA addresses. If these contracts do not implement `onERC721Received` the ERC721 token will be locked in the bridge.

There is no warning of this behavior in docs or code.

## Vulnerability Detail

The bridge implements a `bridgeERC721To` function that allows a caller to send NFT to an address on L1/L2. 
The NFT is sent from the to the corresponding layer and is either minted or transferred to the `_to` address.

If the `_to` address is a contract without an `onERC721Received` implementation - the NFT will be locked in the bridge.

On L1 `L1ERC721Bridge`:
```solidity
    function finalizeBridgeERC721(
------
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) external onlyOtherBridge {
------
        IERC721(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(address(this), _to, _tokenId);
------
    }
```

On L2 `L2ERC721Bridge`:
```solidity
    function finalizeBridgeERC721(
------
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) external onlyOtherBridge {
------
        IOptimismMintableERC721(_localToken).safeMint(_to, _tokenId);
------
    }
```

Both `IOptimismMintableERC721` `safeMint` and `safeTransferFrom` use OpenZeppelin `_checkOnERC721Received` and revert if the target is a contract without the `onERC721Received` implementation.

```solidity
    function _checkOnERC721Received(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes memory data
    ) private returns (bool) {
        if (to.isContract()) {
            try IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received(_msgSender(), from, tokenId, data) returns (bytes4 retval) {
                return retval == IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;
            } catch (bytes memory reason) {
                if (reason.length == 0) {
                    revert("ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer");
                } else {
                    /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
                    assembly {
                        revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))
                    }
                }
            }
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
```

OpenZeppelin has implemented both `_safeMint` and `safeTransferFrom` in order to prevent user errors that transfer to contracts that cannot handle ERC721. In our case reverting will not prevent the user error, instead it will lock the NFT up. 

Therefore, it is safer and more reasonable to "force" transferring/minting of the NFT

## Impact

Users NFT will be locked permanently in the bridge.

There could be multiple use-cases where NFT would be sent to a contract without `onERC721Received` implementation.

An example use-case:
1. On L1 Alice has a smart wallet/multisig/vault that holds the NFT and does not onERC721Received. Alice sends the NFT from her smart wallet/multisig/vault to her EOA address on L2 through `bridgeERC721To` to interact with L2 protocols.
2. Alice EOA on L2 decides to send back her NFT to her smart wallet/multisig/vault through `bridgeERC721To`
3. The NFT will be locked on the L1 bridge because the bridge cannot send transfer to her smart wallet/multisig/vault

## Recommendation

While it is complex to validate the recipient of the NFT on the other layer there are some possible changes that can help.

Instead of calling `safeMint` or `safeTransferFrom`, the bridge can call the `mint` and `transferFrom` to "force" the transferring of the token. After the call, attempt to call the `onERC721Received` of the recipient a using the following code:
```solidity
if (Address.isContract(_to)) {
    try IERC721Receiver(_to).onERC721Received(address(this), _from, _tokenId, "") returns (bytes4 retval) {
    } catch (bytes memory reason) {}
```

Another possible solution is to add `_to` to the ERC721 approvals and require the caller to "pull" the NFT.
