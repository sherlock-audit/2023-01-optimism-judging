  - **Description:** L2OutputOracle can lock Ether
  - **Reason:** The only key that can call the payable function `proposeL2Output` is the proposer. In the `op-proposer` package, no value is ever specified for the `proposeL2Output` transaction.
  - **Action:** We could possibly add a function to retrieve Ether, but while we are the sole proposer, this is not a priority nor a possibility.
