# ERC721 tokens can be left locked in the L1 Bridge during withdrawal.

## Summary
The L1ERC721Bridge uses `safeTransferFrom()` to transfer the bridged NFT tokens. When used with the `bridgeERC721To()` this call can revert due to the recipient not supporting the `IERC721Receiver` interface, which locks it in the bridge without any possibility to recover the asset.
This can be seen as the user's responsibility to check whether the recipient does indeed support this interface, but then you should also take the stance to transfer the token regardless of the recipient supporting the interface. 
Also note that however unimaginable at this point there may be legitimate reasons why a user would want/need to do this.

## Vulnerability Detail
When withdrawing a previously bridged NFT the user can call the `bridgeERC721To()` on the Layer2 ERC721 bridge to bridge the asset directly to a contract on L1.  The `finalizeBridgeERC721` message is then relayed to the ERC721 bridge on L1 where utimately the ERC721 is [transfered](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L68) via `safeTransferFrom()`. This `safeTransferFrom()` can fail when the recipient doesn't respond as required on the `onERC721Received()` call. Although this would indicate an inability of the recipient to handle the ERC721, it does constitute withholding the user initiated transaction and certainly should not result in the token being locked in the bridge. 
You either decide to prevent such an error and give the user back control of their asset or you honor the user's input.

Note: this same issue is present in the other direction where `safemint()` is used to [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ERC721Bridge.sol#L70) the new tokens in the `L2ERC721Bridge`.

## Impact
An ERC721 withdrawn to L1 might be stuck in the L1Bridge without any possibility to recover.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Several options are possible to mitigate this issue.
- Use `transferFrom()` if `safeTransferFrom()`reverts. This would adhere to the user's action which could possibly still result in a locked NFT, but without blame to the protocol.
- You might consider marking the ERC721 withdrawal as failed in the bridge if the `safeTransferFrom()` fails or send it to a separate vault where governance has the ability to withdraw those NFTs from the vault or bridge and decide what to do with them.
