# User ERC721 is permanently locked in L1ERC721Bridge if user specifies incorrect _remoteToken

## Summary

The ERC721 bridge allows the user to transfer ERC721 between L1 and L2. Due to the structure of the finalize functions, if a user specifies an incorrect _remoteToken address their ERC721 will be permanently locked in the bridge

## Vulnerability Detail

        require(
            _remoteToken == IOptimismMintableERC721(_localToken).remoteToken(),
            "L2ERC721Bridge: wrong remote token for Optimism Mintable ERC721 local token"
        );

In L2ERC721Bridge#finalizeBridgeERC721 the function will revert if `_remoteToken != IOptimismMintableERC721(_localToken).remoteToken()`. This would occur if the user specifies the incorrect _remoteAddress during bridging. Currently the bridge offers no way for the user to recover their NFT and because of the revert, the transfer can never be completed resulting in the ERC721 being permanently locked.

## Impact

Users will permanently loss their ERC721 token

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of reverting the transaction the data should be stored and the user should be allowed to call a function on the L2 bridge to to send a message back and reclaim their NFT back from the L1 bridge
