# old L2CrossDomainMessanger won't allow calling legacy L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER but new L2CrossDomainMessanger would allow it and wrong state would be set and attacker can deceive old off-chain programs

## Summary
Contract L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER  has been used in the old version to send messages from L2 to L1 and Contract L2CrossDomainMessanger won't allow calling to L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER  when processing cross domain messages. but new implementation of the L2CrossDomainMessanger(old and new L2CrossDomainMessanger has same address) allows the old L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER to be called by cross domain messages and even so old L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER  has no usage in the new design(it has replaced by L2ToL1MessagePasser which has new address) but other off-chain or on-chain projects that are not yet updated and checks the states in the L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER, can be deceived and attacker can spoof any message from anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail
old version of the L2CrossDomainMessenger won't allow calls to L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER when processing cross domain messages to prevent other spoofing L2 to L1 messages. This is part of the `relayMessage()` in the old L2CrossDomainMessanger:
```solidity
        // Prevent calls to OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser, which would enable
        // an attacker to maliciously craft the _message to spoof
        // a call from any L2 account.
        if (_target == Lib_PredeployAddresses.L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER) {
            // Write to the successfulMessages mapping and return immediately.
            successfulMessages[xDomainCalldataHash] = true;
            return;
        }
```
As you can see it prevent calls when `_traget` is L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER.
after the migration the address of the L2CrossDomainMessnger don't changes and only gets updated but contract L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000000) would be replaced by L2ToL1MessagePasser(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000016) which handles the L2 to L1 messages in bedrock. the new L2CrossDomainMessnger won't allow calls to L2ToL1MessagePasser but it allows calls to the old L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER:
```solidity
    function _isUnsafeTarget(address _target) internal view override returns (bool) {
        return _target == address(this) || _target == address(Predeploys.L2_TO_L1_MESSAGE_PASSER);
    }
```
and the new implementation of the LegacyMessagePasser contract still set the state variable:
```solidity
contract LegacyMessagePasser is Semver {
    /**
     * @notice Passes a message to L1.
     *
     * @param _message Message to pass to L1.
     */
    function passMessageToL1(bytes memory _message) external {
        sentMessages[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_message, msg.sender))] = true;
    }
}
```
So if there were some projects in L1 which relay on state of the address (0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000000) for messages transferred from L2 to L1 and they work with L2CrossDomainMessanger, then after the migration attacker can send messages from L2CrossDomainMessanger to the LegacyMessagePasser and an attacker to maliciously craft the _message to spoof a call from any L2 account. by this attacker can hack those protocols that relay on LegacyMessageParsser. there could be some off-chain tools and sites that read the states of the LegacyMessagePasser which can be deceived too.
the steps are this:
1. ProjectA has contract in L2 and in L1 and users can send funds from L1 to L2 and reverse in the ProjectA and ProjectA uses the L2CrossDomainMessnger to send the messages to L1.
2. ProjectA code trust the messages received from L2 if they are in the LegacyMessageParsser state and the sender is the L2CrossDomainMessnger address as code won't allow attackers to craft and spoof messages. (won't allow call to LegacyMessageParsser in the realyMessages)
3. after the migration attacker would send a message from L1CrossDomainMessanger to L2 and attacker would set the `target` as LegacyMessageParsser and set the `message` such that it would be like ProjectA's L2 contract sending message through L2CrossDomainMessanger and LegacyMessangeParser to ProjectA's L1 contract.
4. then protocol would send message to L2CrossDomainMessanger through OptimisimPortal and L2CrossDomainMessanger send the message to the LegacyMessageParser with attacker specified message.
5. then LegacyMessageParser would set the `sentMessages[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_mesage, msg.sender))] = true` and after the L2 output published in the L1 attacker can call ProjectA's L1 contracts and ProjectA L1 contract would check and see that the L2CrossDomainMessanger send a message to LegacyMessageParser and it would procces the message.

code should prevent calls from L2CrossDomainMessanger to LegacyMessageParser as it was prevented in the previous versoin.

## Impact
Attacker can craft any message from L2 to L1 for those projects that still depend on the legacy message passer. as there is no block number in the message those projects can't detect that if this is a new message or the old one.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
As new L2CrossDomainMessanger prevent calls to L2ToL1MessagePasser address it should prevent calls to LegacyMessageParser too by updating `_isUnsafeTarget()` function.
