  - **Description:** Proxy storage collision risk
  - **Reason:** This is a non-issue at the moment, but the suggestion has merit. In the `contracts-bedrock` package, we take care to ensure that the storage slots of all contracts are not altered without express intention via the `storage-snapshot` script (which also is diff-checked in our CI). However, this is a less effective method of preventing storage slot collisions during upgrades than the suggestion to use EIP-1967 style storage slots or `clones-with-immutable-args`.
  - **Action:** #action At some point in the near future, we should consider using EIP-1967 style storage slots or CWIA to prevent storage slot collisions during upgrades.

# Proxy storage collision risk

## Summary
Certain 'meant to be' immutable parameters of implementation contracts are set to non eip1967 type storage slots on the proxy. An upgrade of the implementation contract carries the risk of  storage slot collision. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Most parameters of implementation contracts that are meant to be immutable throughout the life of the contracts are set as immutables in the implementation contracts (as recommended by the OpenZeppelin audit). Certain variables (for example `startingBlockNumber` in `L2OutputOracmle`) are however set as regular storage slots during initalization as the value of these are not known during deployment of the implementation contract, only later after other contracts have been deployed and initialized. 

Both methods have their pros and cons. Immtuables in the implementation contracts have the risk of being changed during upgrades as the values need to be set and validated during the upgrade. This would be espescially dangerous for `L2_BLOCK_TIME` as this is [used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L329) in the `computeL2Timestamp()`.
Storage variables in the proxy contract have the downside of technically being possible to be changed during normal operation of the contract (although this would require a vulnarability in the current or future code). They do however not need to be re-initialized during an upgrade but still cary the risk of storage slot collision exactly because they don't need or rather must not be re-initialized during an upgrade. `startingTimestamp` and `staringBlockNumber` are espescially at risk here because they also are [used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L329) in the `computeL2Timestamp()`.

[Clones with immutables](https://github.com/wighawag/clones-with-immutable-args/) is an effective way to make variables truely immutable at the proxy level. They can't be modified during the life of the contract nor during an upgrade of the implementation contracts. This does require some significant changes in the codebase however and might not be realistic at this point.
An alternative simpler modification to mitigate against the storage collision during upgrades would be to use eip1967 style storage slots where the storage slot would for instance be computed as ``bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.optimism.L2OutputOracle.startingBlockNumber')) - 1)``

## Impact
Risk of storage slot collision and value change during implementation contract upgrades for important parameters of the protocol that need to be immutable.

## Recommendation
Make use of [Clones with immutables](https://github.com/wighawag/clones-with-immutable-args/) if possible or use EIP1967 type slots for immutable variables that need to be stored at the proxy level.
