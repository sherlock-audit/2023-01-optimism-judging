# The `relayMessage` does not support backwards compatibility with the v0 failed messages

## Summary
The `relayMessage` function does not allow the replayability of the version 0 failed messages

## Vulnerability Detail
The `relayMessage` function does not allow the replayability for the messages that are already played once successfully. However, for failed messages in `failedMessages` it is possible that they are replayed by any user in the network.
While this function supports the replayability for v1 messages, it does not support v0 failed messages and they should be sent through the other messenger first where in the case of L2 to L1 messages might take 7 days!

## Impact
Users that had v0 failed messages should send their messages from the other messenger again and can not replay their transactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `failedMessages` code can be easily changed to the code below:
```solidity
            bytes32 oldHash = Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0(_target, _sender, _message, _nonce);
            require(
                failedMessages[versionedHash] || failedMessages[oldHash],
                "CrossDomainMessenger: message cannot be replayed"
            );
```
