# LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) doesn't forward the transaction to the sequencer

## Summary
LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) doesn't forward the transaction to the sequencer when receiving it over RPC.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user submits a transaction to op-geth node (validator/verfier mode), the node sends the transaction to the sequencer, if no error, it adds it to the tx pool.

```sh
func (b *EthAPIBackend) SendTx(ctx context.Context, tx *types.Transaction) error {
	if b.eth.seqRPCService != nil {
		data, err := tx.MarshalBinary()
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		if err := b.eth.seqRPCService.CallContext(ctx, nil, "eth_sendRawTransaction", hexutil.Encode(data)); err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}
	return b.eth.txPool.AddLocal(tx)
}
```

However, when LES, It only adds the transaction to the tx pool.

```sh
func (b *LesApiBackend) SendTx(ctx context.Context, signedTx *types.Transaction) error {
	return b.eth.txPool.Add(ctx, signedTx)
}
```

Note: Sequencer http flag is configured only if we're running in verifier mode.

## Impact
- Transction isn't sent to the sequencer and will never be processed (submitted to L1).
- Inconsistency among op-geth nodes validators/verifiers and the sequencer.
- Additionally, from UX perspective, it is misleading as the user would think the transaction was submitted "successfully".

## Code Snippet
Check above.

## Recommendation
Match this RPC change in the LES RPC. As it seems to be overlooked.
