## Vulnerability Detail
[L01] Unsafe ERC20 Operation

## Impact
Issue Information: [L01](https://github.com/byterocket/c4-common-issues/blob/main/2-Low-Risk.md#l001---unsafe-erc20-operations)

## Code Snippet
[L01 Finding1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L101)
```solidity
IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);
```

## Tools used
[c4udit](https://github.com/byterocket/c4udit)

## Recommendation
Consider using safeTransferFrom() or check the return value of transferFrom()

## Vulnerability Detail
[L02] Unspecific Compiler Version Pragma

## Impact
Issue Information: [L02](https://github.com/byterocket/c4-common-issues/blob/main/2-Low-Risk.md#l003---unspecific-compiler-version-pragma)
While this often makes sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of an application, it may be a security risk for the actual application implementation itself. A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up actually checking a different evm compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

## Tools used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a require(0 == msg.value) to ensure no Ether is being sent to the exchange when the currency used in an order is a ERC20 token.

## Vulnerability Detail
[L06] The state changing function is not emiting an event

## Impact
This might cause some issues on the interface.

## Code Snippet
