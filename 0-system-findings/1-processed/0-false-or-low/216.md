# Default transferFrom in ERC721Bridge Allows Stealing of Stuck Tokens And Other Unintended Behaviors

## Summary
The L1 ERC721Bridge has a transferFrom function with no check of whether it succeeded. This results in certain ERC20s that don't revert on a failed transferFrom being able to be withdrawn from the contract by anyone if they happen to be in there. 

In addition to this scenario, the lack of checks on the transferFrom can result in weird scenarios like transferring ERC20s through the ERC721 bridge rather than through the ERC20 bridge. To do this the user just needs to transferFrom their ERC20, the contract will set the amount they transferred to true, they must have a remote token that allows the bridge to mint and follows ERC721 interface rules, then they can bridge back the same amount to withdraw the ERC20 from the ERC721 bridge. I couldn't figure out any way for this to actually do harm, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was one.

If you have 2 OptimismMintable tokens and have the L2 one able to be minted by the ERC721 bridge and the L1 minted by the ERC20 bridge, you can continuously mint them back and forth forever ))<>((. I'm sure it has other unintended behavior with this lack of checks that I didn't discover as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ERC20 stealing scenario:
1. ERC20 that does not revert on an improper transfer (such as ZRX https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code) gets sent to the ERC721Bridge contract.
2. Malicious actor calls the bridge to transfer a large amount of that ERC20 to a remote token they've created.
3. Malicious actor withdraws back from the remote token, and is now able to remove all of the ERC20 that was stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Not a huge amount of harm can be done with this, but it will result in stolen funds.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/407f97b9d13448b766624995ec824d3059d4d4f6/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L101 shows the unprotected transferFrom and lack of checks before it that can lead to weird stuff happening.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change this transferFrom to a safeTransferFrom that ensures the function did not fail. In the same vein as this and the StandardBridge bug I submitted as well, there should likely be checks to ensure the user is interacting with an ERC721 contract or other problems could occur.
