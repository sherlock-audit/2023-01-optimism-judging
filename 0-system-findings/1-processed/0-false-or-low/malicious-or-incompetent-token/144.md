# TODO: No check for feeOnTransfer Tokens - Which will not work with the bridge

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol#L187

```solidity
        IERC20(_l1Token).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
```

FeeOnTransfer Tokens will transfer amount but the balance credited will be the amount minus a fee

When using those tokens (famously USDT has a switch to enable fee), the Bridge will end up becoming under collateralized
As it will issue X tokens for X - Fee In.
