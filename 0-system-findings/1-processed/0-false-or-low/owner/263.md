# Incorrect owner check

## Summary
The depositTransaction of OptimismPortal can directly be called by user instead of intermediate contract. This means from address wont be aliased. But this is not considered in CrossDomainOwnable contract which plainly undoL1ToL2Alias the caller

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume `depositTransaction` is called by User A directly. Since no intermediary contract so no aliasing is done
2. On L2 side, if _checkOwner is checked

```solidity
function _checkOwner() internal view override {
        require(
            owner() == AddressAliasHelper.undoL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender),
            "CrossDomainOwnable: caller is not the owner"
        );
    }
```

3. This will try undoL1ToL2Alias on User A address and then match with owner which is incorrect since User A address was never aliased on L1

## Impact
The owner check might fail for genuine transaction

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This check need to be revised. If the transaction came directly from tx.origin (without any intermediary contract) then no need of removing aliasing
