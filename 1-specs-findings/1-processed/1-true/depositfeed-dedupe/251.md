# `DepositFeed` is not inherited in the `OptimismPortal` contract

## Summary

Withdrawals specification stated that `OptimismPortal` inherits `DepositFeed`  which is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

The withdrawals specification wrongfully claims that `OptimismPortal` inherits `DepositFeed` - https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/withdrawals.md

"The Optimism Portal serves as both the entry and exit point to the Optimism L2. It is a contract which inherits from the [DepositFeed](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/deposits.md#deposit-contract) contract, and in addition provides the following interface for withdrawals:

[WithdrawalTransaction type](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6c6d142d7bb95faa11066aab5d8aed7187abfe38/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Types.sol#L76-L83)
[OutputRootProof type](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6c6d142d7bb95faa11066aab5d8aed7187abfe38/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Types.sol#L33-L38)

"

This is incorrect.

## Impact

Misleading withdrawal specification.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The relevant contract that is inherited from is should be `libraries/Types.sol`.
