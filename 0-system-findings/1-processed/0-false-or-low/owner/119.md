# Risky Push over Pull Pattern in Setting Proxy Admin

## Summary

Proxy Admin plays an important role in proxy contracts. The `ChangeProxyAdmin()` function in the `ProxyAdmin` contract, and the `ChangeAdmin()` function in the `Proxy` contract, both use the Push over Pull pattern, which means that if the `_newAdmin` is invalid, all the privileged admin functions would not be callable. It is much safer to use the Pull pattern, where the `_newAdmin` would have to make a function call to accept the role, to prevent the risk of accidentally setting an invalid address to be admin. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer to the description and the code snippet

## Impact

Potential loss of access to all privileged functions in the proxy contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider refactoring the proxy admin transfer using the "Pull over Push" pattern, requiring the designated new admin of the contract to call the contract in order to claim the privileged role.
