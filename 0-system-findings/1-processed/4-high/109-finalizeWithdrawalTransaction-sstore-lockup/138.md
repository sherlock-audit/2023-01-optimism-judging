# Optimism Portal can run out of gas due to incorrect overhead estimation

## Summary

In contrast to `CrossDomainMessenger` which has a 5k gas buffer, the Optimism Portal doesn't, meaning all its relayed calls will have 5k+ less gas than intended.

This forces integrations (e.g. Bridges) to spend more gas by default, because of a logic flaw.

For this reason am filing the finding as Medium Severity:
- Programming Mistake (Math is incorrect)
- Call forwards less gas than intended and can revert because of it


## Vulnerability Detail

`CrossDomainMessenger` will compute the gas-required, adding a 5k gas buffer
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L318-L324

It will then pass the remainder of the gas, minus the buffer as it's assumed to have been spent for the SSTORE

Optimism Portal on the other hand will not do that

## Impact

By only checking that
```solidity
gasleft() >= _tx.gasLimit + FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER /// @audit At least gasLimit + buffer
```

The check will ensure that before the SSTORE + Call the buffer is available

However, the following SSTORE will consider 5k+ (5k for SSTORE, hundreds of gas for overhead)

This will leave the SafeCall with less gas than intended
```solidity
            gasleft() - FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER, /// @audit gasLeft will be < tx.gasLimit because we've subtracted the same constant
```

`SafeCall` will have less gas than intended, meaning that every integrator that estimates their TXs accurately will have their tx revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recompute the buffer to add the extra 5k + the overhead of the SSTORE (in the few hundreds of gas)

To ensure the call has enough gas, you may also consider swapping positions between the SSTORE and the require

```solidity
        // Set the l2Sender so contracts know who triggered this withdrawal on L2.
        l2Sender = _tx.sender;

        require(
            gasleft() >= _tx.gasLimit + FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,
            "OptimismPortal: insufficient gas to finalize withdrawal"
        );

        // Trigger the call to the target contract. We use SafeCall because we don't
        // care about the returndata and we don't want target contracts to be able to force this
        // call to run out of gas via a returndata bomb.
        bool success = SafeCall.call(
            _tx.target,
            gasleft() - FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,
            _tx.value,
            _tx.data
        );
```
