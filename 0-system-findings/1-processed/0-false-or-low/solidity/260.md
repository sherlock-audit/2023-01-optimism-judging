# Steal funds using Portal

## Summary
It seems you can give arbitrary `_data` while calling `depositTransaction` function in OptimismPortal.sol. This means you can spoof a call to l2 bridge with sender as l1 bridge and thus withdraw/steal all funds as shown

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Attacker calls `depositTransaction` with below args

```solidity
_to = OTHER_MESSENGER
_value = 0
_gasLimit= _gasLimit
_isCreation=false
_data = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                this.relayMessage.selector,
                messageNonce(),
                L1StandardBridge.sol,
                L2StandardBridge.sol,
                msg.value,
                _minGasLimit,
                abi.encodeWithSelector(finalizeBridgeERC20, WETH,WETH_REMOTE, ANY_ADDR, ATTACKER_ADDR, WETH_AMOUNT, "")
            )
```

2. This deposit transaction is recorded and executed

3. This calls OTHER_MESSENGER contract's `relayMessage` function with _sender as L1StandardBridge and target as L2StandardBridge (as shown in step 1 payload)

4. Thus xDomainMsgSender is set to L1StandardBridge

```solidity
xDomainMsgSender = _sender;
```

5. Now L2StandardBridge is called with args (finalizeBridgeERC20, WETH,WETH_REMOTE, ANY_ADDR, ATTACKER_ADDR, WETH_AMOUNT, "")

```solidity
bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_GAS_BUFFER, _value, _message);
```

6. This calls finalizeBridgeERC20 function with args (WETH,WETH_REMOTE, ANY_ADDR, ATTACKER_ADDR, WETH_AMOUNT, "") where function args stand for 

```solidity
finalizeBridgeERC20(
        address _localToken,
        address _remoteToken,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    )
```

7. The onlyOtherBridge requirement fulfill as sender is L1StandardBridge and function executes
8. This mints the wrapped remote weth to ATTACKER_ADDR with   WETH_AMOUNT which is wrong

## Impact
Attacker can steal user and contract funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If `depositTransaction` function is directly called then do not allow _to address to be OTHER_MESSENGER
