# Contracts enables ownable and pausable at the same time causing a Denial of Service

## Summary

Contracts enables ownable and pausable at the same time causing a Denial of Service

## Vulnerability Detail

The contracts [L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol) and [L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol) are both ownable and pausable at the same time this potentially causing a Denial of Service

## Impact

1. The contract is set to `pausable`
2. The owner call the function `rrenounceOwnership`
3. Now the contract can no longer be used / be set to `unpause`

## Code Snippet

The contracts become pausable and ownable with [optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L45-L46](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L45-L46)
```Solidity
abstract contract CrossDomainMessenger is
    CrossDomainMessengerLegacySpacer,
    OwnableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
```
[optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L16](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L16)
```Solidity
contract L1CrossDomainMessenger is CrossDomainMessenger, Semver {
```
[optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L18)
```Solidity
contract L2CrossDomainMessenger is CrossDomainMessenger, Semver {
```

## Tool used

- Manual Review
- Remix IDE

## Recommendation

Owner resignation while the contract is paused should be avoided. It is advised to disable the `pausable` option or to block the owner from renouncing ownership if the contract is paused.
