# CrossDomainOwnable.sol and CrossDomainOwnable2.sol lack two-step ownership transfer

## Summary

OZ's Ownable.sol implements a single step ownership transfer which means that ownership can accidentally be transferred to an inoperable or incorrect address.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary.

## Impact

Owner may accidentally transfer ownership to inoperable or incorrect address

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

CrossDomainOwnable.sol and CrossDomainOwnable2.sol should override the transfer mechanism to a two-step push pull ownership structure, in which the current owner pushes the transfer to the new owner and the new owner must manually pull the ownership to confirm the transfer
