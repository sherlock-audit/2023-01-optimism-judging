# Migration Process Can Be DOSed By Anyone

## Summary

The migration process can be DOSed by anyone causing reputation damage, delaying the migration, and causing griefing to the OP team.

## Vulnerability Detail

#### Section 1 - `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function

In pre-bedrock, `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function is permissionless. Thus, anyone can call this function with an arbitrary `_message`. Under normal circumstances, it is expected that only the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` will call this function. However, since it is permissionless, malicious users can call this function to insert withdrawal into the storage slot of the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract, which will prove to be problematic later during the migration.

Subsequently, the caller's address and their `_message` will be hashed and encoded to generate the transaction hash to be used as the key for the `sentMessages` mapping. The contract's `sentMessages` mapping is used to verify the existence of the transaction hash that the user has submitted.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/predeploys/OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L29

```solidity
File: OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol
29:     function passMessageToL1(bytes memory _message) public {
30:         // Note: although this function is public, only messages sent from the
31:         // L2CrossDomainMessenger will be relayed by the L1CrossDomainMessenger.
32:         // This is enforced by a check in L1CrossDomainMessenger._verifyStorageProof().
33:         sentMessages[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_message, msg.sender))] = true;
34:     }
```

#### Section 2 - About State Dump File

When someone calls `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function, the following `Call` function in the `evm.go` will be triggered. Within the `Call` function, it will call the `WriteMessage` function of the state dumper at Line 208.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/op-geth/core/vm/evm.go

```go
File: evm.go
202: // Call executes the contract associated with the addr with the given input as
203: // parameters. It also handles any necessary value transfer required and takes
204: // the necessary steps to create accounts and reverses the state in case of an
205: // execution error or failed value transfer.
206: func (evm *EVM) Call(caller ContractRef, addr common.Address, input []byte, gas uint64, value *big.Int) (ret []byte, leftOverGas uint64, err error) {
207: 	if addr == dump.MessagePasserAddress {
208: 		statedumper.WriteMessage(caller.Address(), input)
209: 	}
```

The caller address and transaction data pass into the `WriteMessage` function and these data will be written to the state dump file located at `L2GETH_STATE_DUMP_PATH` environment variable.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/l2geth/statedumper/dumper.go#L55

```go
File: dumper.go
55: func (s *FileStateDumper) WriteMessage(sender common.Address, msg []byte) {
56: 	s.mtx.Lock()
57: 	defer s.mtx.Unlock()
58: 	if _, err := s.f.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("MSG|%s|%x\n", sender.Hex(), msg))); err != nil {
59: 		panic(err)
60: 	}
61: }
```

The following new line consists of the caller address (sender) and transaction data (msg) will be added to the state dump file.

```solidity
MSG|<sender>|<msg>
```

Assume that Alice's address is `0x536fbBaE279fd77FAe3E29b410f7B605bf45BC8b`. If she calls the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function with an arbitrary message, the following line will be found in the state dump file.

```solidity
MSG|0x536fbBaE279fd77FAe3E29b410f7B605bf45BC8b|<tx_data_from_alice>
```

#### Section 3 - Converting State Dump File To `SentMessageJSON` objects in JSON Files (evm-messages.json)

Before the migration, the following script will be executed to parse the state dump files and generate the `evm-messages.json` migration data.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/migration-data/bin/cli.ts#L18

```typescript
File: cli.ts
17: program
18:   .command('parse-state-dump')
19:   .description('parses state dump to json')
20:   .option('--file <file>', 'path to state dump file')
21:   .action(async (options) => {
22:     const iface = getContractInterface('OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser')
23:     const dump = fs.readFileSync(options.file, 'utf-8')
24: 
25:     const addrs: string[] = []
26:     const msgs: any[] = []
27:     for (const line of dump.split('\n')) {
28:       if (line.startsWith('ETH')) {
29:         addrs.push(line.split('|')[1].replace('\r', ''))
30:       } else if (line.startsWith('MSG')) {
31:         const msg = '0x' + line.split('|')[2].replace('\r', '')
32:         const parsed = iface.decodeFunctionData('passMessageToL1', msg)
33:         msgs.push({
34:           who: line.split('|')[1],
35:           msg: parsed._message,
36:         })
37:       }
38:     }
39: 
40:     fs.writeFileSync(
41:       './data/evm-addresses.json',
42:       JSON.stringify(addrs, null, 2)
43:     )
44:     fs.writeFileSync('./data/evm-messages.json', JSON.stringify(msgs, null, 2))
45:   })
```

The generated `evm-messages.json` JSON file will have the following format:

```solidity
{
    "who": "<caller address>",
    "msg": "<transaction data>"
},
{
    "who": "<caller address>",
    "msg": "<transaction data>"
}
```

Referring back to the same example in the previous section, assume that Alice's address is `0x536fbBaE279fd77FAe3E29b410f7B605bf45BC8b`, then one of the lines within the state dumper file will be as follows:

```solidity
MSG|0x536fbBaE279fd77FAe3E29b410f7B605bf45BC8b|<tx_data_from_alice>
```

As such, the generated `evm-messages.json` JSON file will be as follows:

```solidity
..other SentMessageJSON objects..
{
    "who": "0x536fbBaE279fd77FAe3E29b410f7B605bf45BC8b",
    "msg": "<tx_data_from_alice>"
},
  {
    "who": "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007",
    "msg": "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"
  },
..other SentMessageJSON objects..
```

Almost all of the `SentMessageJSON` objects will have their `who` key set to `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007` as this is the address of the `L2CrossDomainMessenger`.

However, there is one (1) `SentMessageJSON` object that has its `who` key set to `0x536fbBaE279fd77FAe3E29b410f7B605bf45BC8b` which is Alice's address. Note that this one JSON object will be the reason that breaks the migration process.

#### Section 4 - Execution Will Abort During Migration

During the migration, it will attempt to convert a `SentMessageJSON` object to a `LegacyWithdrawal` struct as shown below. The `Decode` function will be called during the conversion.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/genesis/migration/types.go#L43

```go
File: types.go
40: // ToLegacyWithdrawal will convert a SentMessageJSON to a LegacyWithdrawal
41: // struct. This is useful because the LegacyWithdrawal struct has helper
42: // functions on it that can compute the withdrawal hash and the storage slot.
43: func (s *SentMessage) ToLegacyWithdrawal() (*crossdomain.LegacyWithdrawal, error) {
44: 	data := make([]byte, len(s.Who)+len(s.Msg))
45: 	copy(data, s.Msg)
46: 	copy(data[len(s.Msg):], s.Who[:])
47: 
48: 	var w crossdomain.LegacyWithdrawal
49: 	if err := w.Decode(data); err != nil {
50: 		return nil, err
51: 	}
52: 	return &w, nil
53: }
```

Within the `Decode` function, Line 64 will check if the sender of the withdrawal is initiated by `L2CrossDomainMessenger`. If not, the function will return an error and the execution will halt.

Recall that in our example, one of the withdrawals is initiated by Alice. Thus, this will cause the `Decode` function to return an error, and the migration process will stop.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/crossdomain/legacy_withdrawal.go#L53

```go
File: legacy_withdrawal.go
52: // Decode will decode a serialized LegacyWithdrawal
53: func (w *LegacyWithdrawal) Decode(data []byte) error {
54: 	if len(data) < len(predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr)+4 {
55: 		return fmt.Errorf("withdrawal data too short: %d", len(data))
56: 	}
57: 
58: 	selector := crypto.Keccak256([]byte("relayMessage(address,address,bytes,uint256)"))[0:4]
59: 	if !bytes.Equal(data[0:4], selector) {
60: 		return fmt.Errorf("invalid selector: 0x%x", data[0:4])
61: 	}
62: 
63: 	msgSender := data[len(data)-len(predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr):]
64: 	if !bytes.Equal(msgSender, predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr.Bytes()) {
65: 		return errors.New("invalid msg.sender")
66: 	}
```

## Impact

Malicious users or competitors could attempt to DOS the migration process causing reputation damage, delaying the migration, and causing griefing to the OP team.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Understood from the sponsor that only legacy withdrawals initiated by the L2CrossDomainMessenger will be migrated.

Consider updating the script to push only legacy withdrawals initiated by L2CrossDomainMessenger to the JSON file (evm-messages.json). This ensures that the JSON file only contains legacy withdrawals initiated by L2CrossDomainMessenger so that it is impossible for the decoding process to error out during the migration.
