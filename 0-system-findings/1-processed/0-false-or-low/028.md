# SystemDictator allows to proceed with next steps after exit1 is called

## Summary
SystemDictator allows to proceed with next steps after exit1 is called. Because of that bedrock can be deployed, when `OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger` address is still pointing to old address and `DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK` is not set.
## Vulnerability Detail
SystemDictator contract if important for upgrading to bedrock version.
This contract is initialized with some configs and then do step by step upgrade of system.

[`currentStep` variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/deployment/SystemDictator.sol#L150) is responsible for storing current step of upgrade. Using [`step` modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/deployment/SystemDictator.sol#L139-L143) SystemDictator restricts calls to further steps. Everything should be called step by step.

It's possible that after 2 steps, smth will go wrong. For such reason there is `exit1` function which can be called only when current step is `EXIT_1_NO_RETURN_STEP`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/deployment/SystemDictator.sol#L411-L425
```solidity
    function exit1() external onlyOwner {
        require(
            currentStep == EXIT_1_NO_RETURN_STEP,
            "SystemDictator: can only exit1 before step 3 is executed"
        );


        // Reset the L1CrossDomainMessenger to the old implementation.
        config.globalConfig.addressManager.setAddress(
            "OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger",
            oldL1CrossDomainMessenger
        );


        // Unset the DTL shutoff block which will allow the DTL to sync again.
        config.globalConfig.addressManager.setAddress("DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK", address(0));
    }
```

This function set back address of `OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger` and reset `DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK` to 0.

Pls, note that this function doesn't change `currentStep`, so it's still `EXIT_1_NO_RETURN_STEP`.
Because of that it's still possible to call `step3` function which uses `step(EXIT_1_NO_RETURN_STEP)` modifier.

In case if `step3` function will be called by mistake and upgrade process will proceed till the finish, then bedrock will be deployed together with old system as `step2` is undone.
## Impact
The bedrock will be deployed together with old system.
## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In case if `exit1` is called, then change `currentStep` to value 1(to start from the beginning) or even set it to 0 as in this case maybe you don't need any step works in dictator.
