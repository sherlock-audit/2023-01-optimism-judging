# [Low] Withdraw flow in the specs isn't what implemented in OptimisimPortal contract

## Summary
the withdraw specs page says that: 
"The OptimismPortal contract retrieves the output root for the given block number from the L2OutputOracle's getL2OutputAfter() function, and performs the remainder of the verification process internally."
but in the `proveWithdrawalTransaction()` code get `_l2OutputIndex` from caller.
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Proves a withdrawal transaction.
     *
     * @param _tx              Withdrawal transaction to finalize.
     * @param _l2OutputIndex   L2 output index to prove against.
     * @param _outputRootProof Inclusion proof of the L2ToL1MessagePasser contract's storage root.
     * @param _withdrawalProof Inclusion proof of the withdrawal in L2ToL1MessagePasser contract.
     */
    function proveWithdrawalTransaction(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
        uint256 _l2OutputIndex,
        Types.OutputRootProof calldata _outputRootProof,
        bytes[] calldata _withdrawalProof
    ) external {
```
Then according to the specs this is optimism portal interface but code is not like this:
```solidity
interface OptimismPortal {

    event WithdrawalFinalized(bytes32 indexed);

    function l2Sender() returns(address) external;

    function proveWithdrawalTransaction(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
        uint256 _l2BlockNumber,
        Types.OutputRootProof calldata _outputRootProof,
        bytes[] calldata _withdrawalProof
    ) external;

    function finalizeWithdrawalTransaction(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx
    ) external;
}
```
