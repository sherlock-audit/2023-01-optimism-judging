# A malicious proposer can prevent finalizing the unproven withdrawal transactions

## Summary

A malicious proposer inserts a withdrawal transaction in two different L2 block numbers that will be proposed in two different `l2Outputs` indices. The first `l2Outputs` is valid, but the second one is invalid. Then, the malicious proposer immediately proves the withdrawal transaction with the index of the second `l2Outputs`. Later, the second `l2Outputs` will be challenged and deleted. Now, the withdrawal transaction is only in the first `l2Outputs`, but proved by second `l2Outputs` (with incorrect `outputRoot`). So, the withdrawal can not be proved again, therefore can not be finalized, because the second `l2Outputs` with invalid `outputRoot` is deleted.

## Vulnerability Detail

For simplicity assume that:
 - length of the array `l2Outputs` is 100, so there are already the `l2Outputs` indices 0 to 99.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L50
 - `startingBlockNumber` is 1000.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L40
 - `SUBMISSION_INTERVAL` is 120. It means that `l2Outputs[0].l2BlockNumber` is equal to `1120` (1000 + 120), and for the last index we have `l2Outputs[99].l2BlockNumber` equal to `13000` (1000 + 100*120)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L20

Suppose Alice (an innocent user with a large amount of fund) sends a withdrawal message to `L2ToL1MessagePasser` on L2 to receive her fund on L1.

Alice's withdrawal transaction is supposed (it is correct) to be inserted into a block number between `13001` to `13120` by the proposer. But, since the proposer is a malicious actor (called Bob), he inserts Alice's withdrawal transaction into a L2 block number between `13001` to `13120` as well as between `13121` to `13240`. In other words, this withdrawal transaction is inserted into two blocks.
Please note that `latestBlockNumber` is now 13000 and there are now 100 `l2Outputs`. So blocks `13001` to `13120` will be inserted into `l2Outputs` with index 100, and blocks `13121` to `13240` will be inserted into `l2Outputs` with index 101. Therefore, since Alice's withdrawal transaction is included in two blocks (one between `13001` to `13120`, and one between `13121` to `13240`), it will be included in both `l2Outputs` 100 and 101. Please note that inserting Alice's withdrawal transaction into exactly which block number is not the main discussion here (it is just for better explanation), the main point is that the withdrawal transaction be inserted into **two** different `l2Outputs`.

Bob generates correct `_outputRoot` and calls the function `proposeL2Output` to propose the `l2Output` with following parameters:
 - `_outputRoot` = valid data
 - `_l2BlockNumber` = 13120
 - `_l1BlockHash` = not important for this scenario
 -  `_l1BlockNumber` = not important for this scenario
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L160

So, `l2Outputs[100].l2BlockNumber` is 13120 with valid `outputRoot`. Since, the `outputRoot` is generated correctly (without any malicious action), `l2Outputs` with index 100 is a correct output and will not be challenged.

Then Bob generates fake `_outputRoot` and calls the `proposeL2Output` to propose the l2Output with following parameters:
 - `_outputRoot` = fake data
 - `_l2BlockNumber` = 13240
 - `_l1BlockHash` = not important for this scenario
 -  `_l1BlockNumber` = not important for this scenario

So, `l2Outputs[101].l2BlockNumber` is 13240 with invalid `outputRoot`. Since the `outputRoot` is not correct, it will be challenged later by the `Challenger`.

Then Bob calls the function `proveWithdrawalTransaction` to prove Alice's withdrawal transaction with the following parameters:
 - `_tx` = Alice's withdrawal transaction
 - `_l2OutputIndex` = **101** Please note that Bob is giving the number 101 as index of `l2Outputs` not 100
 - `_outputRootProof` = fake data
 - `_withdrawalProof` = fake data
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L160

Please note that Bob created the fake data as follows:
 - `storageKey` (this is generated from the `withdrawalHash`) is a data that Bob can not manipulate.
 - So, Bob gives a fake (arbitrary) `_withdrawalProof`. This arbitrary `_withdrawalProof` along with the `storageKey` gives an arbitrary root. Bob uses this root as a fake `messagePasserStorageRoot`.
 - Bob puts this fake `messagePasserStorageRoot` beside other arbitrary data `version`, `stateRoot`, and `latestBlockhash`.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Types.sol#L33
 - Bob uses this structure as `_outputRootProof` and `_withdrawalProof` as parameters during proving the withdrawal transaction.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L163
 - Bob gets a hash from this structure `_outputRootProof` to calculate a fake `outputRoot`.
 - Bob uses this calculated fake `outputRoot` to propose the `l2Outputs` with index 101. So, `l2Outputs` with index 101, has this fake `outputRoot` generated through the above mentioned steps.


Since the proposed `l2Output` with index 101 has fake `outputRoot` (it is generated by Bob), so the following check can be passed easily:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L180

Since this withdrawal transaction is the first time to be proved, its timestamp is equal to zero:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L195

Since `messagePasserStorageRoot` is part of the struct `_outputRootProof ` (this is also generated by Bob), and also the `_withdrawalProof` is provided by Bob, the following check will be easily passed:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L215


Finally the mapping `provenWithdrawals[Alice's withdrawalHash]` will be updated as follows:
 - `outputRoot` = fake value proposed by Bob
 - `timestamp` = current timestamp
 - `l2OutputIndex` = **101**

So far, Alice's withdrawal transaction is included in both `l2Outputs` 100 and 101, and it is proved with `l2Outputs` index 101.

Then during the challenge window, the verifier notices something is wrong with `l2Outputs` with index 101. The verifiers sees that there is totally invalid data (`OutputRoot`). So, the `Challenger` deletes the `l2Outputs` with index 101 by calling the function `deleteL2Outputs`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L128

Please note that Alice's withdrawal transaction was included in a block between `13001` to `13120` as well as a block between `13121` to `13240`. Blocks between `13001` to `13120` were part of `l2Outputs` with index 100 which has valid data (so it is not  challenged). But blocks `13121` to `13240` were part of `l2Outputs` with index 101 which is challenged and deleted.

Now, Alice's withdrawal transaction is only included in `l2Outputs` with index 100 (since `l2Outputs` with index 101 is deleted), but it was proven with `l2Outputs` with index 101.

Later, new `l2Outputs` will be proposed by honest proposer, and the proposer is not going to include Alice's withdrawal transaction in `l2Outputs`  with index 101, 102, or anything after. Because, her transaction is already in the valid `l2Outputs` with index 100.

Then, Alice decides to finalize her withdrawal on L1, and she calls the function `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L243

But it will be reverted, because the `l2Outputs` with index 101 (that includes Alice's transaction) now has different `outputRoot`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L291

So, Alice decides to prove again her transaction by calling the function `proveWithdrawalTransaction`. But it reverts also:
- First: her transaction has already a non-zero timestamp (it was once proved by Bob with fake data for the `L2Outputs` with index 101).
- Second: her transaction is included in `l2Outputs` with index 100 while the mapping `provenWithdrawals[Alice's withdrawalHash] = 101`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L196

The attack summary is:
1. Propose a valid `l2Outputs` with index 100 including the Alice's withdrawal transaction
2. Propose an invalid `l2Outputs` with index 101 including the Alice's withdrawal transaction
3. Proving the Alice's withdrawal transaction with `l2Outputs` with index 101

The solution is that the `Challenger` deletes both `l2Outputs` with indices 100 and 101, and inserts the Alice's withdrawal transaction into the `l2Outputs` with index 101.

But, this solution does not work always. Because, if Bob proposes an invalid `l2Outputs` with index 101 including all the old unproven withdrawal transactions (for example the unproven withdrawal transactions in `l2Outputs` with index 20, 21, 22, ...), and immediately proves them with `l2Outputs` with index 101, all those transactions can not be finalized. So, the `Challenger` must delete all these `l2Outputs` with index from 20 to 101.

Please note that the attack scenario can be as follows either:
 - Bob is just assigned as the proposer or the proposer account is compromised.
 - Bob notices the transaction `proveWithdrawalTransaction` in the Mempool.
 - He immediately front-runs this transaction.
 - He generates the fake `outputRoot` (including this withdrawal transaction) and proposes a new `l2Outputs`.
 - Then, he immediately calls the function `proveWithdrawalTransaction` to prove that this transaction is in this fake newly proposed `l2Outputs`.
 - Then, when the original `proveWithdrawalTransaction` in the Mempool is going to be executed, it will be reverted because of `OptimismPortal: invalid output root proof`.
 - Since this fake newly proposed `l2Outputs` will be deleted by the `Challenger`, this withdrawal transaction will not be able to be finalized anymore, because the index of the fake `l2Outputs` is set in the mapping `provenWithdrawals`.

## Impact
This can result in deleting a lot of `l2Outputs` that can have large impact on the protocol and user's experience. Or, it may result in prevent of finalizing the withdrawals.
## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It may make sense allowing to re-prove the withdrawal transactions by the related authority (`Challenger` or the next honest `proposer`). So, if this scenario happens, the related authority can re-prove the withdrawal transaction, even though the `l2Outputs` index and `outputRoot` are both different from what included in the mapping `provenWithdrawals`.
```solidity
function prepareForReprovingWithdrawalTransaction(
    Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
    uint256 _l2OutputIndex,
) public onlyChallenger{
    bytes32 withdrawalHash = Hashing.hashWithdrawal(_tx);
    require(provenWithdrawals[withdrawalHash].l2OutputIndex != _l2OutputIndex, "should be different indices");
    provenWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] = ProvenWithdrawal({
        outputRoot: bytes32(0), // set to zero so that it must be proved again
        timestamp: uint128(block.timestamp),
        l2OutputIndex: uint128(_l2OutputIndex) // set to the correct index
    });
}
```
