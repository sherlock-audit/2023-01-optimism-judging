  - **Description:** Unchecked to and from address are not 0 can lead to unexpected burn of funds.
  - **Reason:** This is a non-issue, and it is up to the user to ensure that they are not sending funds to the zero address (or any incorrect address, for that matter).

# # [M-04] Unchecked to and from address are not 0 can lead to unexpected burn of funds.

## Summary

In the following function:

     https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L397-L434
     https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1StandardBridge.sol#L281

The function :

function \_initiateBridgeERC20(
address \_localToken,
address \_remoteToken,
address \_from,
address \_to,
uint256 \_amount,
uint32 \_minGasLimit,
bytes memory \_extraData
) internal {
the is no validation for the to and from inuts, which could be the 0 address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Is calling the finalizeBridgeERC20 in the other contract which makes the transfer to the `to` address. In this case, the `to` address is not checked if it is not 0. So, if the `to` address is 0, the funds will be burned.

## Impact

User funds can be burned if the `to` address is 0 due to unexistent validation

## Tool used 
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add require statements such as:

     require(_to != address(0));
     require(_from != address(0));
