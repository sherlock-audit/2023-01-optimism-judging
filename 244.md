# Re-proving a withdrawal would fail if `_l2OutputIndex` grows beyond `2^128 - 1`

## Summary

`l2OutputIndex` is downcast from uint256 to uint128 when proving withdrawals. If it ever grows past `2^128 - 1` attempts to re-prove a withdrawal would fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `proveWithdrawalTransaction` has the following check when re-proving a withdrawal:

```solidity
        require(
            provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 ||
                (_l2OutputIndex == provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex &&
                    outputRoot != provenWithdrawal.outputRoot),
            "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven"
        );
```

The `l2OutputIndex` downcast from uint256 to uint128 as follows:

```solidity
provenWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] = ProvenWithdrawal({
            outputRoot: outputRoot,
            timestamp: uint128(block.timestamp),
            l2OutputIndex: uint128(_l2OutputIndex)
        });
```

If `_l2OutputIndex` ever grows past `2^128 - 1`, the comparision `_l2OutputIndex == provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex ` needed to re-prove a withdrawal would fail.

## Impact

Re-proving withdrawals would fail.
