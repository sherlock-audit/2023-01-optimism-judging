# [H-01] No capability to hold ERC721 tokens. NFTs will be lost

## Summary

The bridging contracts:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ERC721Bridge.sol
do not have the capability to hold ERC721 tokens. So, if a user deposits an ERC721 token, it will be lost forever. The problem is that there is no onERC721Received function in the bridging contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The bigger problem is that the following line:

        IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);

does not use safeTransferFrom, so it does not check that the bridge contract can hold an erc721 token. So, if the bridge contract does not have the capability to hold ERC721 tokens, the user will lose his NFT forever.

## Impact

Loss of NFTs for whoever tries to bridge them.

## Tool used 
Manual Review

## Recommendation

import the IERC721Receiver interface and add the:

function onERC721Received(
address operator,
address from,
uint256 tokenId,
bytes calldata data
) external returns (bytes4);

function. And use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom in the bridging contracts.
