# [Low] comments says that if bridging fails in other chain then tokens would be returned but code is not returning the funds if the bridging fails

## Summary
the comments for functions `bridgeERC20To()` and `bridgeERC20()` in StandardBridge says that "Note that if the ERC20 token on the other chain does not recognize the local token as the correct pair token, the ERC20 bridge will fail and the tokens will be returned to sender on this chain." but code wouldn't return the ERC20 tokens if the bridge operation fails in the other chain.
