# High disparity between prevBaseFee and block.basefee makes block stuffing possible

## Summary
High disparity between prevBaseFee and block.basefee makes block stuffing possible

## Vulnerability Detail
In ResourceMetering.sol, the gas to burn on L1 is determined the following way:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L138-L145

with a gas limit of 21_000 on L1, and `MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT=8_000_000`, this means that
if `params.prevBaseFee/block.basefee == 21000/MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT` ~= 380

a user can use MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT in a single transaction, effectively blocking other users from entering the block.

and given already seen 100 gwei gas prices on L1, and an initial base fee of 1 gwei on `ResourceMetering`, reaching the factor or getting close to it seems possible.

## Impact
Users can stuff a block and remove the possiblity for other users to get their deposit transaction included

## Recommendation
Limit `_amount` for a single transaction to a factor of MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT
