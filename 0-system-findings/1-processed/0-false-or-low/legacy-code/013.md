# ERC165Checker may revert instead of returning false

## Summary

ERC165Checker may revert instead of returning false in the contract [L2StandardBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol).

## Vulnerability Detail

In [optimism/packages/contracts/package.json#L76](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/package.json#L76) it was found the outdated version `4.3.2` of `@openzeppelin/contracts` then imported by multiple contracts, particularly from [L2StandardBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol). This raises an issue when checking if a contract implements an interface and support of ERC165 since it may revert instead of returning false.

## Impact

 `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is intended to always return a boolean and not to revert. However, if a target contract fails to implement EIP-165 as intended, especially if it produces a value other than 0 or 1, `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` might revert due to the fact that Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` reverts if the bytes rawhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol data overflow the target type.

The problem in the contract is that [L2StandardBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol) uses `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface but then doesn't handle the lack of it by reverting.

## Code Snippet

The outdated version of `@openzeppelin/contracts` is the following: [optimism/packages/contracts/package.json#L76](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/package.json#L76)
```json
"@openzeppelin/contracts": "4.3.2"
```

The contract [L2StandardBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol) imports the outdated `@openzeppelin/contracts` in:
[optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L10](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L10):
```Solidity
import { ERC165Checker } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165Checker.sol";
```

It is also worth noting that the pragma solidity version of [L2StandardBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L2) is `0.8.9` since this issue is specific for the Solidity versions `0.8`:
```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
```

The code affected by this problematic is in the function [`finalizeDeposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L141-L187):
```Solidity
    function finalizeDeposit(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge) {
        // Check the target token is compliant and
        // verify the deposited token on L1 matches the L2 deposited token representation here
        if (
            // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
            ERC165Checker.supportsInterface(_l2Token, 0x1d1d8b63) &&
            _l1Token == IL2StandardERC20(_l2Token).l1Token()
        ) {
            // When a deposit is finalized, we credit the account on L2 with the same amount of
            // tokens.
            // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
            IL2StandardERC20(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);
            // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
            emit DepositFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
        } else {
            // Either the L2 token which is being deposited-into disagrees about the correct address
            // of its L1 token, or does not support the correct interface.
            // This should only happen if there is a  malicious L2 token, or if a user somehow
            // specified the wrong L2 token address to deposit into.
            // In either case, we stop the process here and construct a withdrawal
            // message so that users can get their funds out in some cases.
            // There is no way to prevent malicious token contracts altogether, but this does limit
            // user error and mitigate some forms of malicious contract behavior.
            bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IL1ERC20Bridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal.selector,
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
                _from,
                _amount,
                _data
            );

            // Send message up to L1 bridge
            // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
            sendCrossDomainMessage(l1TokenBridge, 0, message);
            // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
            emit DepositFailed(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
        }
    }
```

The problematic arises when `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is called to check if a contract implements an interface and support of ERC165:
[optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L153](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L153)
```Solidity
ERC165Checker.supportsInterface(_l2Token, 0x1d1d8b63) &&
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is highly suggested to update `@openzeppelin/contracts` to the [most recent version, `4.8.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/contracts), or at least to the version `4.7.1` since the issue highlighted is patched from this version.
