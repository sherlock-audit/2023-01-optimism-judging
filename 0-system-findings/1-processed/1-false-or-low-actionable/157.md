**Severity:** This is correct, but low risk. It's a footgun, not an exploit.

# FSM Issue with Exit1 - Code allows to continue but after Exit1 you should be forced to Finalize

## Summary

The Sponsor setup `exit1` to end the migration prematurely in case of any potential risk.

The transition from `exit1` will force the sponsor to `finalize`, however there is no check in the code to prevent them from calling all the steps such as `step5` which should exclusively be called while block production is paused.

I understand the sponsor will not make such a mistake per the scope, however the finding highlights an issue with the FSM when using `exit1`

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/deployment/SystemDictator.sol#L408-L425

Exit 1 brings back the `oldL1CrossDomainMessenger`

However, it doesn't bring the Dictator back to `step2`, meaning that after calling `exit1` the Dictator will be unable to set `OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger` to `0` and set the `DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK`

## Impact

The Transition from `step4` to `step5` should not be allowed if the early exit happened, if that transition did happen, the `DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK` will still be `0` meaning that L2 will be producing blocks while upgrading, causing unintended blocks to be part of the L2.

## Code Snippet

The code doesn't enforce the inability to perform step5 after an early exit, but early exit will have `DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK` unset, meaning that L2 will be producing blocks mid update

- step1
- step2 -> DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK is set
- exit1 -> DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK is unset
- step3 -> Not particularly dangerous
- step4 -> Passing of ownership which would happen in finalize -> not dangerous
- step5, etc... Upgrade is happening while DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK is unset

The FSM state transitions are also visualized here:
https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPqwc68E=/?share_link_id=282485312165

The specific risk is in the fact that after calling `exit1` the DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK cannot be set again, meaning there's no way to set it back to the current block, meaning block production wouldn't pause.

If `exit1` brought the `currentStep` back to `2`, we would achieve idempotency and be able to "start over" with the same config.

Alternatively we could enforce the early exit by bricking `step5`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have `exit1` also move the `currentStep` back to 2
```solidity
    function exit1() external onlyOwner {
        require(
            currentStep == EXIT_1_NO_RETURN_STEP,
            "SystemDictator: can only exit1 before step 3 is executed"
        );
        --currentStep;
```

Or force `step5` to also check for an early exit and always revert in that case.
```solidity
    function step5() external onlyOwner step(5) {
    address shutoff = config.globalConfig.addressManager.getAddress(
            "DTL_SHUTOFF_BLOCK",
            address(uint160(block.number))
        );
     require(shutoff != address(0));
```
