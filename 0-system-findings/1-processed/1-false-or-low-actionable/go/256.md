# Rollup nodes fail to detect incorrect account storage proofs

## Summary

Rollup nodes fail to detect incorrect account storage proofs due to a coding error in `account_proof.go`. This bug affects the `ReadStorageAt()` usage and can cause a rollup node to load an arbitrary sequencer address from an untrusted L1 RPC node.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `op-node/eth/account_proof.go` file defines the `Verify()` function for rollup nodes to verify an `AccountResult` (i.e., an account's state) against the given state root. This function also verifies the list of storage proofs (i.e., `StorageProofEntry`) associated with this account. Each storage proof includes a storage key, value, and Merkle proof, and this function calculates the derived value from the given key and proof, using the account's storage hash and `geth`'s `trie.VerifyProof()` function.

The last step of storage verification at L55-L57 is supposed to check whether the derived storage value matches the given untrusted storage value. However, a programming error at L55 fails to do so:

```solidity
if !bytes.Equal(val, val) {
    return fmt.Errorf("value %d in storage proof does not match proven value at key %s (path %x)", i, entry.Key, path)
}
```

The first and second arguments of `bytes.Equal()` are set to `val`, which makes `bytes.Equal(val, val)` always evaluates to `true`. The storage value, `entry.Value`, is never used or checked against `val`. As a result, the storage verification always passes regardless of the given storage value. To construct a PoC for this issue:

1. Go to file `op-node/eth/account_proof_test.go`.
2. Change the `value` at L30 to any other value.
3. Run `cd op-node && go test -run TestAccountResult_Verify -v ./eth`. The test will pass.

## Impact

Generally speaking, since `AccountResult.Verify()` fails to detect an incorrect storage proof, every usage of this function is affected by this bug. A malicious adversary can forge a storage proof and trick the rollup node into thinking that an account's storage slot has some incorrect value.

The most critical usage of `AccountResult.Verify()` is in the `ReadStorageAt()` function of the `op-node/sources/eth_client.go` file. In the `ReadStorageAt()` function, if the RPC endpoint is untrusted, the function calls `GetProof()` to query the storage proof from the RPC endpoint (via the `eth_getProof` call) and verify it with `Verify()`. However, due to this bug, the untrusted RPC node can return any storage value it wants to the rollup node but still pass the verification.

Currently, in the codebase, `ReadStorageAt()` is only used in the `Load()` function in `op-node/node/runtime_config.go`, which reads the storage slot of the L1 system config contract (via the underlying L1 RPC node) to get the sequencer's address. As a result, the untrusted L1 RPC node can make the rollup node accept an arbitrary sequencer address.

Let's assume that the attacker controls some L1 RPC nodes, which some rollup nodes connect to. By exploiting this bug, the attacker makes the rollup nodes think the attacker is the sequencer. The rollup nodes will then reject blocks from the real sequencer during the unsafe block propagation but accept blocks from the attacker (see `op-node/p2p/gossip.go#L264-L270`).

As the nodes keep broadcasting blocks not signed by the real sequencer, others will reject them because of the incorrect signature and eventually ban them. The attacker effectively makes the nodes be punished due to their involuntary misbehavior. Moreover, if the majority of rollup nodes are under attack, the nodes will accept the attacker proposed unsafe L2 blocks but fail to consolidate them later. The attacker forces the nodes to fall back to build L2 blocks using L1 data and thus degrades the L2 network performance even if the real sequencer behaves honestly.

Note that this attack works even when the L1 RPC nodes are untrusted (i.e., without the `--l1.trustrpc` flag being set), which is the default setting.

## Recommendation

Check `val` with `entry.Value` at L55 instead.
