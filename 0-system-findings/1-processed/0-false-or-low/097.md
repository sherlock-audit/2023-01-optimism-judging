# Users can have NFTs stolen by a malicious bridge attack

## Summary

There are many mainnet tokens that have addresses that can be predicted in advance of deployment. A bug in the ERC721 and Standard Bridges lead them to both accept deposits from tokens that don't yet exist. This combination of facts can be used to create completely legit OptimismMintableERC20s or ERC721s with fake deposits that allow the creator to rug users.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are many mainnet tokens whose addresses can be predicted in advance, including Uniswap LP positions, factories that use CREATE2 deployments, etc.

Both the L1ERC721Bridge and the StandardBridge have a flaw where they are able to accept deposits of any token that does not yet exist:
- On the StandardBridge, the transfer is performed with the following call: `IERC20(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);`
- On the L1ERC721Bridge, the transfer is performed with the following call: `IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);`
- Because the EVM returns `success` for any function call to an EOA, both of these transfers will "succeed", despite nothing being transferred into the contract (this is true even for the `SafeERC20` library used for the ERC20 bridge).
- In both of these cases, the transaction will flow through the bridge and the OptimismMintableERC20 or ERC721 will be minted on L2.

These two vulnerabilities can be combined to create a dangerous situation. A malicious user can deploy a completely kosher OptimismMintableERC20 or ERC721 corresponding to a token that has not yet been deployed. The L2 contract will be deployed from the Factory and all the code will be as expected. 

They can then call `bridgeERC20()` or `bridgeERC721()` on the L1 bridge, increasing the bridge's tracked balance of the token as well as the amount minted on L2. Anyone who watches the L1 bridge will see a completely valid looking deposit transaction.

However, when the token is released and users begin to transfer it to L2, the L1 Bridge will begin to fill with real tokens, but it will be insolvent relative to the number of L2 tokens that have been minted. 

The malicious user can then withdraw their tokens, profiting and leaving the bridge insolvent for all other depositors.

## Impact

The bridges are designed in a way where a user can intentionally create insolvency for not-yet-deployed tokens, which can set them up to steal funds from any users who use their pair. 

If users were forced into using this pair of tokens for bridging, this issue would be a High severity. In reality, they are technically able to avoid using this malicious pair, but there is no signal in the transactions or contracts that would make them think to do so.

The result is that users are very likely to lose funds to an attack like this, mainly as a result of Optimism not performing adequate checks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 

There should be an explicit check in both bridges that the native token being bridged is in fact a deployed contract before increasing the `deposits` balance and kicking off the bridging process:
```diff
if (_isOptimismMintableERC20(_localToken)) {
    ...
} else {
+   require(Address.isContract(_localToken), "StandardBridge: token doesn't exist");
    IERC20(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
    deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] + _amount;
}
```
