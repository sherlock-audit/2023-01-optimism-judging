# EOA Check is sidesteappable by transferingTo

## Summary

In spite of the EOA-Check for self-bridging, the EOA check is not applied to the `_to` argument of the Bridge Implementation

Meaning that end-users may mistakenly bridge to a contract, sidestepping the EOA check and potentially causing a loss of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The EOA check is sidestepped by using the `_to` field, which doesn't check that the recipient is not a contract

## Impact

The check for EOA is bypassed, meaning that the check is ineffective for a fairly common use-case (transferingTo)

Additionally, tokens may be lost because a smart contract not implementing `onERC721Received` will experience reverts when the Bridge calls `safeMint`.

## Code Snippet

This applies to both StandardBridge and ERC721Bridge

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Document the risk, or add the check for contract existence to `_to` as well
