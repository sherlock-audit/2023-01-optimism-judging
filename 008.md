# onlyOwner causes security issues

## Summary
The `onlyOwner` modifier in the function causes some security issues

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/resolver/Lib_AddressManager.sol#L32
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L99

```solidity
    function setAddress(string memory _name, address _address) external onlyOwner {
        bytes32 nameHash = _getNameHash(_name);
        address oldAddress = addresses[nameHash];
        addresses[nameHash] = _address;

        emit AddressSet(_name, _address, oldAddress);
    }
```

## Impact
It's important to ensure that the owner-granting mechanism itself is secure as if an attacker were to gain control of the owner's address they would be able to execute this function.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setAddress(string memory _name, address _address) external onlyOwner {
        bytes32 nameHash = _getNameHash(_name);
        address oldAddress = addresses[nameHash];
        addresses[nameHash] = _address;

        emit AddressSet(_name, _address, oldAddress);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a more secure mechanism for granting and revoking ownership: Instead of using a single address variable to represent the contract owner, consider using a multisignature mechanism or a time-locked contract that requires multiple parties to confirm ownership changes.
