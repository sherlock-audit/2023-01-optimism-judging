# DoS during the migration process by calling L2 message passer directly

## Summary
The migration can be temporarily DoS'ed by directly calling the legacy `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser` predeploy directly, shortly before the process starts.

The Bedrock migration involves upgrading system contracts and modifying contract state while the chain is halted. This includes upgrading the legacy [`OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/predeploys/OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol) predeploy to the new [`L2ToL1MessagePasser`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol) predeploy. Since the legacy contract can hold pending cross-chain messages, its state is also converted and directly written to the new contract's storage. 

The legacy predeploy is not intended to be called directly by users or contracts, since messages submitted this way are not executable on L1 due to a check in the L1 messenger. All L2 -> L1 cross-chain messages (aka `withdrawals`) are designed to flow through the L2 `CrossDomainMessenger`. Calling the predeploy directly is possible however, since the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function is `public`, though this likely never happens.

Calling the legacy contract directly, and not through the `CrossDomainMessenger` as intended, shortly before the migration starts can cause checks during the migration to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the migration the [`migration-data`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/migration-data/bin/cli.ts) package is used to read state off the chain and store it in a JSON file which is later used to make state changes to the contracts. This includes reading and saving cross-chain messages from the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser`. 

This package is unfortunately not really documented and there seem to be two ways in which the script can be run:
- `evm-sent-messages` will include only messages which were submitted through the `CrossDomainMessenger`
- `parse-state-dump` will additionally include messages which were submitted by directly calling the predeploy without going through the `CrossDomainMessenger`. *Note that if this would not be true and the state dump also only contains messages sent through the `CrossDomainMessenger`, this variant would effectively turn into Variant 1*.

Both variants can lead to DoS, though through a differing code path.

### Variant 1: Using `evm-sent-messages`
When the script is invoked with the `evm-sent-messages` parameter, it will read the messages by filtering `CrossDomainMessenger`'s events. Thus, the resulting JSON file will not include messages sent by directly calling the predeploy.

During the migration, the node's database is migrated. The previously generated JSON files are read again

```go
// op-chain-ops/cmd/op-migrate/main.go
// ...
evmMessages, err := migration.NewSentMessage(ctx.String("evm-messages"))
if err != nil {
    return err
}

migrationData := migration.MigrationData{
    OvmAddresses:  ovmAddresses,
    EvmAddresses:  evmAddresess,
    OvmAllowances: ovmAllowances,
    OvmMessages:   ovmMessages,
    EvmMessages:   evmMessages,
}
```

and the migration is started by calling [`MigrateDB`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/e92bc23c2619174a7169ace6d3f2a12c11c0e5df/op-chain-ops/genesis/db_migration.go#L37). In `MigrateDB`, the messages are sanity checked:

```go
// op-chain-ops/genesis/db_migration.go
log.Info("Checking withdrawals...")
filteredWithdrawals, err = crossdomain.PreCheckWithdrawals(db, unfilteredWithdrawals)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("withdrawals mismatch: %w", err)
}
```

If there is an error during this check, the application will exit.

`PreCheckWithdrawals` will read all storage slots from the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser` predeploy

```go
// op-chain-ops/crossdomain/precheck.go
// Build a mapping of the slots of all messages actually sent in the legacy system.
var count int
slotsAct := make(map[common.Hash]bool)
err := db.ForEachStorage(predeploys.LegacyMessagePasserAddr, func(key, value common.Hash) bool {
    // When a message is inserted into the LegacyMessagePasser, it is stored with the value
    // of the ABI encoding of "true". Although there should not be any other storage slots, we
    // can safely ignore anything that is not "true".
    if value != abiTrue {
        // Should not happen!
        log.Error("found unknown slot in LegacyMessagePasser", "key", key.String(), "val", value.String())
        return true
    }

    // Slot exists, so add it to the map.
    slotsAct[key] = true
    count++
    return true
})
```
and then checks that **for all read storage slots, a corresponding entry exists in the previously read list**:

```go
// op-chain-ops/crossdomain/precheck.go
// Iterate over the list of actual slots and check that we have an input message for each one.
for slot := range slotsAct {
    _, ok := slotsInp[slot]
    if !ok {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("unknown storage slot in state: %s", slot)
    }
}
```

Since the list was generated by reading only messages which were submitted through the `CrossDomainMessenger`, a message which was sent by directly calling the predeploy will not be included, this check will fail, and the database migration aborts.


### Variant 2: Using `parse-state-dump`
When the script is invoked with the `parse-state-dump` parameter, it will not read the chain through a RPC but instead use a supplied state dump file, from which it will extract all cross-chain messages. Other than in variant 1, this may include messages which were directly submitted to the predeploy without going through the `CrossDomainMessenger`. The `PreCheckWithdrawals` check will thus pass without issue.

Before `PreCheckWithdrawals` is called, the encoded byte messages from the JSON files are read into the `LegacyWithdrawal` data structure using `MigrationData.ToWithdrawals()` which in turn calls `msg.ToLegacyWithdrawal()` which then calls `LegacyWithdrawal.decode(data []byte)`. The `data` parameter is the `message` parameter supplied to `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser .passMessageToL1` with `msg.sender` appended to the end. When the `CrossDomainMessenger` submits the cross-chain message, its address will be appended to the end. If however, the predeploy is called directly, the caller's address would be appended to the end. This address is later checked:

```go
// op-chain-ops/crossdomain/legacy_withdrawal.go
msgSender := data[len(data)-len(predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr):]
if !bytes.Equal(msgSender, predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr.Bytes()) {
    return errors.New("invalid msg.sender")
}
```

If `msg.sender` is not the `CrossDomainMessenger`, this check will error and the database migration will abort. Since the direct call to the predeploy is included in the list, this check can be caused to fail.

## Impact
Abusing this behaviour can cause the duration during which the network is halted to be significantly extended. An attacker could time calling the predeploy directly just shortly before the migration starts, which will result in previous dry-runs to not catch this issue. If the chain is then down and this issue appears, it would need to first be investigated, a hotfix developed, the hotfix strictly audited since this affects a critical part of the system, and the fix pushed out. This would effectively cause a DoS to the system during the migration process.

I therefore believe this report should fall into the `Client node vulnerabilities - Medium - DoS attacks on critical services` category.

## Recommendation
The pre-checks and conversions need to be designed in a way to handle direct calls to the predeploy. All messages should be read off the chain, not just the ones which were submitted through the `CrossDomainMessenger`. Then during database migration, iterate over the messages and drop the ones which were submitted through a direct call. This will effectively remove them from the state, but this should not cause any issues, since these messages would not be executable on L1 in any case.
