# withdrawals: incorrect function name for L2ToL1MessagePasser::messageNonce



## Summary

There is no function or public variable with the name `nonce` in `L2ToL1MessagePasser`, however the incorrect function name `nonce` was used a couple of times in the withdrawals' specs.


## Vulnerability Detail

The interface for `L2ToL1MessagePasser` includes function `nonce`, but there is no such a function or public variable.

In the below snippet, it mentions again `nonce` causing confusion.

The `nonce` should be the `messageNonce` from `L2ToL1MessagePasser`:

## Impact

factually incorrect information (incorrect name is used)

As it is in the interface code, anybody trying to copy the interface and use it for `L2ToL1MessagePasser` will revert on calling the `nonce` function.
