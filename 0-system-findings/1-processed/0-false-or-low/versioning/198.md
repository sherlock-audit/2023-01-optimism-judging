# Unspecific compiler version pragma

## Summary
As denoted on [SWC-103](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103):

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

## Vulnerability Detail
For some source-units the compiler version pragma is very unspecific, i.e. ^0.8.0. While this often makes sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of an application, it may be a security risk for the actual application implementation itself. 

## Impact
A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up actually checking a different EVM compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider locking the pragma version to the same version as used in all other contracts. (Note: Visit the [known bugs](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases) for the compiler version that is chosen if need be.)

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile it locally.
