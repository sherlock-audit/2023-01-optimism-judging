# MintManager: Token will not exactly mint once per year

## Summary

Because a delay of one year is added at the time of the mint transaction, a minor delay can accrue over time, meaning that mints will not exactly happen once per year as documented

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/governance/MintManager.sol#L71-L72

```solidity
        mintPermittedAfter = block.timestamp + MINT_PERIOD;

```

But one year after previous mint

This can create minor inconsistencies with the intended goal, unless the function is triggered exactly on each interval as any additional time delay will cause the next mint to be delayed by that amount, which will shift each future mints as well

## Impact

Functionality is incorrect vs the Spec

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/governance/MintManager.sol#L71-L72

```solidity
        mintPermittedAfter = block.timestamp + MINT_PERIOD;

```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Using the old `mintPermittedAfter` would allow to ensure the 1 year cadence is fully enforced
```solidity
newMint = mintPermittedAfter + MINT_PERIOD
```
