# NFT Might Be Locked In The Bridges

## Summary

Users' NFT might be stuck in the OP's bridges under certain condition.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the `_to` (destination) does not implement the [`IERC721Receiver`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver)  interface, the NFT will not be able to be sent to the target. The NFT will be locked forever in the ERC721 NFT bridges.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L68

```solidity
File: L1ERC721Bridge.sol
66:         // When a withdrawal is finalized on L1, the L1 Bridge transfers the NFT to the
67:         // withdrawer.
68:         IERC721(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(address(this), _to, _tokenId);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ERC721Bridge.sol#L70
```solidity
File: L2ERC721Bridge.sol
68:         // When a deposit is finalized, we give the NFT with the same tokenId to the account
69:         // on L2. Note that safeMint makes a callback to the _to address which is user provided.
70:         IOptimismMintableERC721(_localToken).safeMint(_to, _tokenId);
```

The `safeTransferFrom` and `safeMint` functions prevent someone transferring or minting ERC721 to a contract that does not implement the [`IERC721Receiver`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver)  interface.

## Impact

Loss of assets for the users as their NFTs are locked in the bridges.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using `tranferFrom` or `mint` so that the NFT will be sent to the target regardless of whether the target implemented the [`IERC721Receiver`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver)  interface. This would be better than the NFT being stuck in OP's bridges with no way to retrieve them.

Alternatively, implement a mechanism to forward the NFT back to the users if the transfer failed.
