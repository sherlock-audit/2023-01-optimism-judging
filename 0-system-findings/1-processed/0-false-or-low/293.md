# # [M-05] Incompatibility with fee on transfer tokens

## Summary
Fee on transfer tokens are not supported. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol?plain=1#L414

In lines:

            IERC20(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
            deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] + _amount;

you can see that the accountability of the funds is done before the transfer. This is not compatible with tokens that have a fee on transfer because eventually the bridge will receive less funds that the user sent.

## Impact

Optimism will be unable to birdge the tokens to the receiver because there won't be enough funds in the bridge contract.

## Tool used 
Manual Review


## Recommendation

     Use balanceAfter - balanceBefore:

    uint256 balanceBefore = deflationaryToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    deflationaryToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), takerPrice);
    uint256 balanceAfter = deflationaryToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    premium = (balanceAfter - balanceBefore);
     deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] + premium;
