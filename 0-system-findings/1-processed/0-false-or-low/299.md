  - **Description:** Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for outgoing erc721 transfers
  - **Reason:** This is an incoming not outgoing transfer, and we know that the Bridge is able to accept ERC721s

# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for outgoing erc721 transfers

## Summary

It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() when transferring ERC721s 

## Vulnerability Detail

The transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom(), which I assume is a gas-saving measure. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

OpenZeppelin’s documentation discourages the use of transferFrom(); use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible
The recipient could have logic in the _initiateBridgeERC721() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom().

## Impact

While unlikely because the recipient is the function caller, there is the potential loss for users should the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721s.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L99-L101

```solidity
        // Lock token into bridge
        deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken][_tokenId] = true;
        IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use safeTransferFrom() in the function initiateBridgeERC721()

```solidity
- IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);
+ IERC721(_localToken).safetransferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);
```
