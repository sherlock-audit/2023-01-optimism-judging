Reason: Disagree that this is an issue. We want unavailable eth removed from state.

# [Low]  should only burn the transferred withdrawal amounts

## Summary
function `burn()` removes all ETH held by the contract from the state but it should only burn the withdrawal amounts and there could be some ETH in the contract balance that are not from withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `burn()` code:
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Removes all ETH held by this contract from the state. Used to prevent the amount of
     *         ETH on L2 inflating when ETH is withdrawn. Currently only way to do this is to
     *         create a contract and self-destruct it to itself. Anyone can call this function. Not
     *         incentivized since this function is very cheap.
     */
    function burn() external {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        Burn.eth(balance);
        emit WithdrawerBalanceBurnt(balance);
    }
```
As you can see it burns all the contract balance. but not all contract balance is withdrawal ETH for sure. for example anyone can increase this contract balance by selfdestruct and sending ETH to this contract or balance can be send before the contract deployment. burning the extra balance can cause the locked ETH in the OptimisimPortal to be lost.

## Impact
contract burn unnecessary balance.

## Recommendation
contract should keep track of the withdrawal amounts and burn only those amounts
