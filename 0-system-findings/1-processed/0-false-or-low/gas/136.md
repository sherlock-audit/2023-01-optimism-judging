# Inaccurate calldata cost estimation (Doesn't account for 0 bytes)

## Summary

Just like the L2 math, calldata will cost 4 gas per 0 bytes and 16 for non-zero bytes

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L214-L215

Message is not guaranteed (nor should be expected to due to risk of clashes on a base-layer tool), to have all non-zero bytes

For example, abi.encoded addresses will have 12 bytes of empty data to fill their 32 bytes words.

Meaning that the following assumption is incorrect:
```cost = bytes * 16```

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Calldata cost is on average overpriced

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L392

As you can see it uses the 16 bytes cost, which is not accurate for 0 value bytes, which would cost 4 gas at the time of the contest

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

See `GasPriceOracleImplementation`
```solidity
    function getL1GasUsed(bytes memory _data) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 total = 0;
        uint256 length = _data.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (_data[i] == 0) {
                total += 4;
            } else {
                total += 16;
            }
        }
        uint256 unsigned = total + overhead();
        return unsigned + (68 * 16);
    }
```

In contrast to `CrossDomainMessenger`s

Have run some benchmarks and believe the cost of estimating to be non-trivial, however, because of `metered` that gas will be burnt anyway, so it may be worth computing the cost accurately

## NOTE:

The reciprocity of calldata cost is proven by the setting in the op-geth node
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/op-geth/params/protocol_params.go#L45

Which confirms that each 0 byte calldata is priced at 4 gwei, not 16

## Mitigation Step

Cost of computing the gas cost is non-trivial, so the following options seems suitable:
1) Reduce / Remove the overhead / multiplication, as you're already overpricing the calldata cost
2) Acknowledge the inconsistency
3) Refactor to change the overhead based on the cost of computing this extra cost (as the excess gas is burnt anyway)
