# Use modifiers only for checks

## Summary
modifier `metered` used for more than just for checks

## Vulnerability Detail
The code inside a modifier is usually executed before the function body, so any state changes or external calls will violate the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Moreover, these statements may also remain unnoticed by the developer, as the code for the modifier may be far from the function declaration.
