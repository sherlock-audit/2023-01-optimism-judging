# Sequencer can not guarantee the inclusion of transactions in `SEQUENCING_WINDOW_SIZE`

## Summary
The `SEQUENCING_WINDOW_SIZE` can never be guaranteed by the sequencer due to weak censorship and reorg, and can possibly lead to an unstable state.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is mostly a design issue and not a vulnerability that can lead to a state where the protocol is not expecting. According to [this page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/f30376825c82f62b846590487fe46b7435213d37/specs/overview.md):
"Whenever the sequencer creates a new L2 block for a given epoch, it must submit it to L1 as part of a batch, within the epoch's sequencing window (i.e. the batch must land before L1 block n + SEQUENCING_WINDOW_SIZE). These batches are (along with the TransactionDeposited L1 events) what allows the derivation of the L2 chain from the L1 chain."
Where it expects sequencer's batches for a certain L1 block to land within L1 + SWS, which is impossible to guarantee since the sequencer's batches can become subject to week censorship or Re-org might happen due to network partition.

## Impact
The impact would highly depend on how protocol handles things:
- L2 transactions: Transactions that are sent to the sequencer on L2, can easily be sent later on another batch, however, batches that are landing out of [L1, L1 + SWS] interval with their first transaction or "L1 deposited transaction" poiting to L1 would be invalid. and if any blocks are built on top of this, next blocks would be invalid.
- The bigger problem happens when none of the batches for epoch L1 land in the SWS window, this means that none of the on-chain deposits landed in the sequencing window which means this can cause the L1 to L2 derivation to be distrupted. 

Another outcome would be that the sequencer has to pay for the batches that land out of the sequencing windows, since these batches are invalid, they have to be replayed and their gas is not paid by the user.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is ideal to send the blocks one after the other, in the current system, batches do not need to arrive in order, however they should be finalize in the sequencing window. 
This problem can be solved by increasing the time between the commitments to the L1 chain while sending all the batches in order, each batch should be numbered and included on the L1 to make sure there is no need to define a SWS. Also, it should be made sure that at least each epoch is finalized in each batch.
