# Loss of precision due to double divisions

## Summary
Each division results in truncation, leading to rounding error that is proportional to the number of divisions entailed. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In ResourceMetering.sol, the modifier `metered()` involves 2 consecutive divisions in one of its arithmetic operations prior to having the result assigned to `baseFeeDelta`. 

## Impact
This double truncation could lead to the calculated value an additional step lesser than its supposed value.

## Code Snippet
[File: ResourceMetering.sol#L94-L96](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L94-L96)

```solidity
            int256 baseFeeDelta = (int256(uint256(params.prevBaseFee)) * gasUsedDelta) /
                TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT /
                BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR;
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider refactoring the affected code lines to only 1 division as follows:

```solidity
            int256 baseFeeDelta = (int256(uint256(params.prevBaseFee)) * gasUsedDelta) /
                (TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT *
                BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR);
```
