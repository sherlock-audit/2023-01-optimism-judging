# High Gas Limit  And Data Injection Attack With Unauthorized Contract Call

## Summary

```solidity
function _sendMessage(
        address _to,
        uint64 _gasLimit,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _data
    ) internal override {
        PORTAL.depositTransaction{ value: _value }(_to, _value, _gasLimit, false, _data);
    }
```

When examining this code, It grabs my attention for the potential security issues, such as Denial-of-service attack (Dos), Reentrancy, Buffer overflows . 

## Vulnerability Detail

DoS : The function accepts a gas limit input, which is sent directly to the `depositTransaction` function. But there is no verification of a reasonable value for the _gasLimit parameter. The network could experience a denial-of-service attack if an attacker is able to supply an arbitrarily high gas limit and exhaust all of the gas that is accessible.

Reentrancy: It provides no protection against *reentrancy* attacks. This can be happen if the `_to` address is an attacker-controlled contract that calls back into the current contract.

Data Validation: The function accepts  `_data`  as a bytes type, with no validation or checks on the data's contents. Without proper validation these data may result in security issues, such as *Buffer overflows* .

Uncontrolled Access : `__sendMessage()` function is declared as internal that means any other contracts within the same deployment can call this function, but there is no any safe self guard to prevent unauthorized caller.

## Recommendation

It is crucial to carefully evaluate the `PORTAL.depositTransaction` function's implementation and the code of any contracts it interacts with.
For minimizing the problems, my thought as below : 

Prevent DoS : A gas-limit cap can be applied to reduce a high gas limit so that a malicious user can't be able to set a very high gas limit. 

```solidity
function _sendMessage(
    address _to,
    uint64 _gasLimit,
    uint256 _value,
    bytes memory _data
) internal override {
    // Apply a gas limit cap
    uint64 allowableGasLimit = 50000;
    require(_gasLimit <= allowableGasLimit, "Gas limit surpassed");

    PORTAL.depositTransaction{ value: _value }(_to, _value, _gasLimit, false, _data);
}
```

Data Validation: To minimize the risk of potential issues from the data payload `_data `parameter can be properly checked to ensure it adheres to specific constraints, such as length and content, before passing it to the `depositTransaction() `function.

```solidity
function _sendMessage(
    address _to,
    uint64 _gasLimit,
    uint256 _value,
    bytes memory _data
) internal override {
    // Apply a gas limit cap
    uint64 allowableGasLimit = 50000;
    require(_gasLimit <= allowableGasLimit, "Gas limit surpassed");
    
    // Checking data's length
    uint256 allowableDataLength = 28;
    require(_data.length <= allowableDataLength, "Data length surpassed");

    PORTAL.depositTransaction{ value: _value }(_to, _value, _gasLimit, false, _data);
}
```

Prevent Uncontrolled Access : `'onlyAuthorized' `modifier can be used as access control mechanism that helps to prevent uncontrolled access.

```solidity
contract L1CrossDomainMessenger is CrossDomainMessenger, Semver {
     // Array of addresses that are authorized 
address[] authorizedContracts;

     // Enforce the access control defined in the modifier
    modifier onlyAuthorized {
        require(
            authorizedContracts.length == 0 ||
            authorizedContracts.indexOf(msg.sender) != -1,
            "Unauthorized contract"
        );
        _;   // Pass the control flow to the protected function
    }
      
   function _sendMessage(
    address _to,
    uint64 _gasLimit,
    uint256 _value,
    bytes memory _data
) internal override onlyAuthorized {
    // Apply a gas limit cap
    uint64 allowableGasLimit = 50000;
    require(_gasLimit <= allowableGasLimit, "Gas limit surpassed");
    
    // Checking data's length
    uint256 allowableDataLength = 28;
    require(_data.length <= allowableDataLength, "Data length surpassed");

    PORTAL.depositTransaction{ value: _value }(_to, _value, _gasLimit, false, _data);
} 
```
