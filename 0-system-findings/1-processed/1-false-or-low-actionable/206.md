# Specification Inconsistency in the Definition of an Ethereum Epoch

## Summary
https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/#blocks talks about an Ethereum epoch as the time between 2 Ethereum blocks. An Ethereum epoch is generally used to mean a group of 32 blocks. https://info.etherscan.com/epoch-in-ethereum/. I'm not sure if it's also used the original way but using epoch to mean the time between 2 blocks makes the documentation confusing.

## Vulnerability Detail
No damage other than misunderstandings

## Impact
Low

## Code Snippet
