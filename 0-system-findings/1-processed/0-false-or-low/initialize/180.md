# [Low] uninitialized implementation contracts in proxy pattern

## Summary
Almost all of the contract in the protocol are based on proxy pattern to be upgradable but some of the implementation contract are not initialized. attacker can become owner of this contract and perform malicious actions. even if there were any clear malicious action right now with every update or change the risk of the bad action by owner of the implementation contract would be there. contracts SystemDictator is not initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
attacker can become owner of the uninitialized implementation contract and perform attacks like selfdestruct or any other attack with higher access.
