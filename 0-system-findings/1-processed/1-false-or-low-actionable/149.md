  - **Description:** Attacker can steal CrossDomainMessenger and OptimismPortal token balances or tokens of anyone give approval for those contracts
  - **Reason:** The reporter is correct that *if* a user approves the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract or `OptimismPortal` contract for spending their tokens, an attacker could steal their tokens via a `transferFrom` message. It is also correct that this is not mentioned within our docs. However, there is no reason that a person should approve these contracts, nor are they encouraged to do so. In addition, there is no reason that either of these contracts should hold tokens apart from ETH to begin with.
  - #action **Action:** We should add an official warning within our docs that users should not approve the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` or `OptimismPortal` contracts to spend their tokens. The reporter is correct that *if* there are tokens within either of these contracts *or* a user has approved them to spend their tokens, an attacker may steal them.

# [medium] Attacker can steal CrossDomainMessenger and OptimismPortal token balances or tokens of anyone give approval for those contracts

## Summary
Contracts CrossDomainMessenger and OptimismPortal are part of the bridge protocol and they are responsible for sending messages between two network. they both call arbitrary address with arbitrary data that user specified and it would give attacker to transfer any funds that those contracts has allowance. users should be informed about this risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
Contract CrossDomainMessenger in function `relayMessage()` calls address with data that are specified by user:
```javascript
        xDomainMsgSender = _sender;
        bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_GAS_BUFFER, _value, _message);
        xDomainMsgSender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;
```
and Contract OptimismPortal in function `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` do the same:
```javascript
        bool success = SafeCall.call(
            _tx.target,
            gasleft() - FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,
            _tx.value,
            _tx.data
        );
```
so attacker can force this contract to make arbitrary call to any address just by initiating the message from another network. if these contract holds any token or has allowance to spend any token (users gives allowance by mistake) then attacker can steal those funds buy creating this message from other network: `target=tokenAddress, data="transferFrom(userAddress, attackerAddress, amount)"`.
Attacker can lure users to send their tokens to this bridge contracts or give spending allowance for this contract. because this contract are formal and standard bridge for the Optimism protocol so users may trust to give spending allowance because allowance only allow those contracts to spend the funds and from user perspective they are legit contract and won't perform any malicious actions.
There is no warning in docs or in code to inform user from this risk.

## Impact
1. if contract OptimismPortal in L1 or contracts CrossDomainMessenger in L1 and L2 have any token balance then attacker can steal them. this balance can be from users which transferred them by mistake or by social engineering.
2. if users give token spending allowance for contract OptimismPortal in L1 or contracts CrossDomainMessenger in L1 and L2 then attacker can steal users tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider giving users warning about this that they shouldn't give allowance to these contracts and contract may perform malicious actions.
