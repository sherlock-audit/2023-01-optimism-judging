# Governance Token Minting Can be Griefed to Result in Lost Funding

## Summary
The minting function of the Governance token is supposed to be able to be called each year through MintManager.sol to mint a certain percent of the total supply. While in perfect scenarios it can mint this much, each second that passes after the minter has the ability to mint before the mint function is actually called is time that is not counting down to when more tokens can be minted. This is because the next time a mint is allowed is based off of the current block timestamp rather than off of when the last period ended.

For example, if you mint tokens on day 0 you must wait until day 365 to mint more. However, if you mint on day 370 instead you must wait until day 735 (rather than day 730) and you're permanently 5 days behind on funds that could be minted.

This comes into play in lowering the amount that can be minted because of normal delays, but it also opens up griefing attacks where an attacker can spam the chain so that tokens cannot be minted, and the longer they do that the less tokens can be minted overall.

## Vulnerability Detail
Allows griefing to occur where the system cannot mint as many tokens as intended.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/dc470550092f4c5be11d000325d011a9efb07778/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/governance/MintManager.sol#L71

Above is the line where mintPermittedAfter is decided based upon the current block.timestamp rather than when the last one ended.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the linked code snippet to: `mintPermittedAfter = mintPermittedAfter + MINT_PERIOD;` It may also be worth doing something like using totalSupply at a specific block, which could avoid more weird things like someone burning tokens to mess with attempts to mint.
