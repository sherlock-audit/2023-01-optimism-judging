  - **Description:** Contract addresses incorrect in transaction receipts
  - **Reason:** The contract address field is non-consensus. As a result, this issue only appears when querying these broken deposits via RPC. The contract address in the state is correct. Reducing to low because it is not a consensus issue.
  - **Action:** Fix the contract address generation

# Incorrect `contractAddress` in tx receipt

## Summary
In [`state_processor.go`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/op-geth/core/state_processor.go#L129) function `applyTransaction` the `ContractAddress` is generated using `tx.Nonce()`, which is always 0 for deposit tx. This causes the `contractAddress` in the tx recipe to be always the same for successive deposit tx from the same sender.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`state_processor.go`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/op-geth/core/state_processor.go#L129) `tx.Nonce()` is used for generating the `ContractAddress` to be put in the tx receipt if the tx creates a contract. For deposit tx the nonce is always zero, so the `contractAddress` in the recipe will always be the same for the deposits from the same sender.
The same issue is present in [`execution.go`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/op-geth/cmd/evm/internal/t8ntool/execution.go#L218)

## Impact
The tx recipe is incorrect as it shows the same contract being created multiple times, while contracts are created without their address being included in the receipts. This will cause issues to external applications querying the receipts to track contract creations. As an example, this already causes issues in the block exporer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the sender account nonce from the state instead of the tx nonce.
```go

 if msg.To() == nil {
-     receipt.ContractAddress = crypto.CreateAddress(evm.TxContext.Origin, tx.Nonce())
+     receipt.ContractAddress = crypto.CreateAddress(evm.TxContext.Origin, statedb.GetNonce(msg.From()))
 }
```
