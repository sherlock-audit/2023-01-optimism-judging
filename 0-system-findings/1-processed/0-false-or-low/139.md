# Burn will stop working once `EIP-4758` is enabled

## Summary

[EIP-4758](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4758) will remove `SELFDESTRUCT`, this will make the `Burner` not work

## Vulnerability Detail

`Burn.eth`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Burn.sol#L13-L16

Deploys a new `Burner`, which will self-destruct and send value to itself as a way to remove that value from circulation

However, the opcode SELFDESTRUCT will be removed once EIP-4758 goes into effect, meaning that the contract will stop working
