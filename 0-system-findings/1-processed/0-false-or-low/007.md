# ERC20 transferFrom is not checked

## Summary

ERC20 transferFrom is not checked

## Vulnerability Detail

Upon successful completion, the transferFrom method returns a boolean value. To determine whether the transfer was successful, this metric must be examined.

## Impact

If the transfer fails, certain tokens return false rather than reverting. Even when a token returns false and doesn't really complete the transfer, it is still considered a successful transfer.

Some examples are [EURS](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8#code) and [BAT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#code) that return false instead of reverting but the transaction will still be counted as successful.

```Solidity
IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);
```

## Tool used

- Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the value of `transferFrom`. Alternatively, it is advised to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20.

An exampe is the following:
```Solidity
import {SafeERC20} from "openzeppelin/token/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

// ...

IERC721(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);
```
