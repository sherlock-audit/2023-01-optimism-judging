# First withdrawal of fees to L1 may malfunction due to unforeseen gas fees

## Summary

L2 gas fees are transported to L1 in order to pay for sequencer costs. It is implemented in `FeeVault.sol`, the recipient of such fees.
```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    require(
        address(this).balance >= MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT,
        "FeeVault: withdrawal amount must be greater than minimum withdrawal amount"
    );
    uint256 value = address(this).balance;
    totalProcessed += value;
    emit Withdrawal(value, RECIPIENT, msg.sender);
    L2StandardBridge(payable(Predeploys.L2_STANDARD_BRIDGE)).bridgeETHTo{ value: value }(
        RECIPIENT,
        20000,
        bytes("")
    );
}
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The bridging request to the L1 `RECIPIENT` has a hardcoded gas limit of 20,000. A close inspection of the CALL opcode [reveals](https://www.evm.codes/#f1?fork=arrowGlacier) 20K may indeed not be sufficient. In case the address is empty, which would likely be the case on the first withdrawal action to L1, there is an added cost of 25K called `value_to_empty_account_cost `. Therefore, the 20K gas cost may be insufficient and the call could be stuck on the L1 bridge. Fortunately, the call is replayable through the `CrossDomainMessenger` service.

## Impact

First withdrawal of fees to L1 may malfunction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider raising the gas limit to a higher amount, such as 40K to allow margin for described costs.
