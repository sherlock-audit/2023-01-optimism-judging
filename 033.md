# Relay of before bedrock failed transactions is not possible after bedrock update

## Summary
 
Due to an upgrade in the message relaying mechanism, pre-bedrock users will not be able to relay failed transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
A feature of the cross domain messengers is to manage and relay transactions between both chains. 
This feature is impacted during migration due change in relaying mechanism.

During the migration from pre-bedrock to bedrock, the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` and `L2CrossDomainMessenger` is updated.
There is a difference from the old version to the new version in the relaying mechanism that can be called by users to try to relay failed transaction again
* Old contract - in order to replay a transaction users need to call `relayMessage` again. It will be callable **as long as the transaction failed**:
`require(successfulMessages[xDomainCalldataHash] == false, "Provided message has already been received.");`
* New contract -in order to replay a transaction users need to call `relayMessage` again. It will be callable **as long as the the failed transaction is stored in `failedMessages` array**: 
`require(failedMessages[versionedHash], "CrossDomainMessenger: message cannot be replayed");`

Because `failedMessages` array does not exist pre-bedrock. Users will not be able to replay the transaction in the new contract.

## Impact

Existing Optimism users relying on the messaging mechanism will not be able to relay a failed transaction due to Optimism update. 

## Code Snippet

Old `relayMessage` in old `L2CrossDomainMessenger` and `L1CrossDomainMessenger`:

New `relayMessage` in shared (L1 and L2) `CrossDomainMessenger`:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For L1: 
Consider during migration to look for "FailedRelayedMessage" messages in the old `L1CrossDomainMessenger` by reviewing on-chain events. When updating the proxy on L1 to the new `L1CrossDomainMessenger`. Create a temporary implementation and add the data from `FailedRelayedMessage` to the `failedMessages` array. After updating, update the implementation to post-bedrock `L1CrossDomainMessenger`

For L2:
Easier, same as migrating legacy withdrawals. Read the `FailedRelayedMessage` and change the stateDB of `L2CrossDomainMessenger` to populated the `failedMessages` array.
