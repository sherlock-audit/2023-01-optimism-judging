  - **Description:** Bridge should use safeTransferFrom to receive ERC721s
  - **Reason:** We know the bridge can receive ERC721 tokens. Also this issue confused the ERC20 and ERC721 safeTransferFrom impls

# UNHANDLED RETURN VALUES OF TRANSFERFROM

## Summary
Call from transferFrom and transfer does not revert on failure so should be checked.

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of transfer and transferFrom could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into require() statements to these failures.

## Impact
The `L1ERC721Bridge` contract uses `transferFrom` to lock nft by transferring the nft from the user to the bridge contract. it's possible the call would fail silently. 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
       // Lock token into bridge
        deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken][_tokenId] = true;
        IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the return value and revert on 0/false or use OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC wrapper functions.
