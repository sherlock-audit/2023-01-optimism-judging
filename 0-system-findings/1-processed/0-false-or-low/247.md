Severity: false
Reason: The issue assumes that there is a difference between a versioned nonce with a version of zero, and a
        a legacy nonce. However because because the version is stored in the left-most 16 bits, legacy nonces
        implicitly have a version of zero.

# Legacy Message Can Be Replayed After Migration Leading To Double-Spend Bug

## Summary

There is a bug while computing the old hash of the legacy message that allows legacy messages to be replayed. This allows anyone who has bridged assets from L2 to L1 before the migration to bridge the assets again for the second time after the migration, effectively resulting in a double-spend bug.

## Vulnerability Detail

The following is the new `relayMessage` function in Bedrock's `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L257

```solidity
File: CrossDomainMessenger.sol
256:     function relayMessage(
257:         uint256 _nonce,
258:         address _sender,
259:         address _target,
260:         uint256 _value,
261:         uint256 _minGasLimit,
262:         bytes calldata _message
263:     ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
264:         (, uint16 version) = Encoding.decodeVersionedNonce(_nonce);
265:         require(
266:             version < 2,
267:             "CrossDomainMessenger: only version 0 or 1 messages are supported at this time"
268:         );
..SNIP..
```

Note that the `_nonce` passed into the new `relayMessage` function is a versioned Nonce that consists of two components (versioning and nonce). The format of the versioned Nonce is as follows:

```solidity
0xVVNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
V = Version Info, N = Nonce Counter
```

During the migration, the LegacyWithdrawal is converted into the new bedrock-style Withdrawal. 

The legacy-style nonce in the LegacyWithdrawal consists only of an Integer Nonce counter without any versioning information. During the conversion, it was replaced with a versioned Nonce. This is done for both the inner `relayMessage` payload and outer withdrawal payload. Refer to Lines 69, 74, and 89 below

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/crossdomain/migrate.go#L54

```go
File: migrate.go
52: // MigrateWithdrawal will turn a LegacyWithdrawal into a bedrock
53: // style Withdrawal.
54: func MigrateWithdrawal(withdrawal *LegacyWithdrawal, l1CrossDomainMessenger *common.Address) (*Withdrawal, error) {
..SNIP..
66: 	// Migrated withdrawals are specified as version 0. Both the
67: 	// L2ToL1MessagePasser and the CrossDomainMessenger use the same
68: 	// versioning scheme. Both should be set to version 0
69: 	versionedNonce := EncodeVersionedNonce(withdrawal.Nonce, new(big.Int))
70: 	// Encode the call to `relayMessage` on the `CrossDomainMessenger`.
71: 	// The minGasLimit can safely be 0 here.
72: 	data, err := abi.Pack(
73: 		"relayMessage",
74: 		versionedNonce,
75: 		withdrawal.Sender,
76: 		withdrawal.Target,
77: 		value,
78: 		new(big.Int),
79: 		withdrawal.Data,
80: 	)
..SNIP..
88: 	w := NewWithdrawal(
89: 		versionedNonce,
90: 		&predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr,
91: 		l1CrossDomainMessenger,
92: 		value,
93: 		new(big.Int).SetUint64(gasLimit),
94: 		data,
95: 	)
96: 	return w, nil
```

The following is the new `relayMessage` function in the Bedrock's `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract. Line 272-278 performs validation to ensure that the legacy version of the message has not already been relayed. It does this by performing the following actions:

1) Decoding the `_nonce` provided to determine the version.
2) If the nonce's version is zero, this means that it is a legacy withdrawal. Compute the old hash by calling `Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0` function with the `_target`, `_sender`, `_message` and `_nonce`
3) Verify if the old hash of the legacy message is set to `true` in the `successfulMessages` mapping. If it is true, this means that the message has already been relayed once before the migration, and the transaction will be reverted to prevent the legacy message from replaying in Bedrock.

The issue here is that the `Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0` expects the legacy-style nonce (without versioning) that contains only the Integer Nonce counter. However, the code passes a versioned nonce into the `Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0` function to compute the old hash of the legacy message. As a result, the hash computed will not match the actual old hash of the legacy message, and `successfulMessages[oldHash]` will return `false`. This allows legacy message that has been relayed before migration to be relayed again in Bedrock after the migration.

```solidity
File: CrossDomainMessenger.sol
256:     function relayMessage(
257:         uint256 _nonce,
258:         address _sender,
259:         address _target,
260:         uint256 _value,
261:         uint256 _minGasLimit,
262:         bytes calldata _message
263:     ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
264:         (, uint16 version) = Encoding.decodeVersionedNonce(_nonce);
265:         require(
266:             version < 2,
267:             "CrossDomainMessenger: only version 0 or 1 messages are supported at this time"
268:         );
269: 
270:         // If the message is version 0, then it's a migrated legacy withdrawal. We therefore need
271:         // to check that the legacy version of the message has not already been relayed.
272:         if (version == 0) {
273:             bytes32 oldHash = Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0(_target, _sender, _message, _nonce);
274:             require(
275:                 successfulMessages[oldHash] == false,
276:                 "CrossDomainMessenger: legacy withdrawal already relayed"
277:             );
278:         }
```

#### Proof-of-Concept

Assume that Mallory is the attacker attempting to exploit this issue, and Mallory's wallet address in both L1 and L2 is `0x536fbBaE279fd77FAe3E29b410f7B605bf45BC8b`.

##### Steps to be done before Bedrock migration:

1) Mallory bridges 100 ETH from L2 to L1 by calling the `L2StandardBridge.withdraw` function

2) The `L2StandardBridge` will call the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` to send a cross-domain withdrawal message to `L1CrossDomainMessenger`

3) The `L2CrossDomainMessenger` will call the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` to store the hash of the cross-domain withdrawal message in the storage of `sentMessages` mapping. The `sentMessages` mapping on the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` will be used by the `L1CrossDomainMessenger._verifyStorageProof()` function at L1 to determine if a message has been sent on L2.

4) Once the cross-domain message gets relayed to L1, the `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` function will be triggered. The `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will call the  `L1StandardBridge.finalizeETHWithdrawal` to transfer 100 ETH to Mallory's address in L1.

5) After the transfer is done, the `successfulMessages[xDomainCalldataHash]` is set to `true` to prevent the message from being replayed. Note that the key of the `successfulMessages` is derived from the `xDomainCalldataHash`. The `xDomainCalldataHash` is generated via the following algorithm:

   ```solidity
   xDomainCalldataHash = keccak256(
   	abi.encodeWithSignature(
           "relayMessage(address,address,bytes,uint256)",
           _target,
           _sender,
           _message,
           _messageNonce <=== this is "999"
       )
   )
   ```

   Assume that the `_messageNonce` here is `999`. Thus, the `999` value is one of the inputs used to compute the hash. Assume that the generated `xDomainCalldataHash` is `c89efdaa54c0f20c7adf612882df0950f5a951637e0307cdcb4c672f298b8bc6`.

   As such, `successfulMessages[c89efdaa54c0f20c7adf612882df0950f5a951637e0307cdcb4c672f298b8bc6] = true`.

##### During the migration:

1. During the migration, all legacy withdrawals from old `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser` will be converted to new bedrock-style withdrawals and stored in the `sentMessages` mapping of the new `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract.
2. At this point, Mallory's cross-domain withdrawal message in the old `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser` has been migrated to the storage of the new `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract.
3. The L1's `L1CrossDomainMessenger` gets upgraded to the new implementation. Note that the state of  `successfulMessages` mapping still exist after the upgrade.

##### Steps to be done after the migration

1. Mallory calls the `OptimismPortal.proveWithdrawalTransaction` to replay the cross-domain withdrawal message that bridges 100 ETH. It is possible for him to prove the withdrawal transaction because it exists in the storage of the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract.

2. After the waiting period (7-day), Mallory calls the `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` function, which will in turn call the `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` function.

   As the withdrawal transaction has been converted to the new bedrock-style withdrawal, the nonce has been changed to a versioned nonce, which consists of the (version + nonce). The new nonce is as follows:

   ```solidity
   0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000999
   0xVVNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
   V = Version Info, N = Nonce Counter
   ```

   ```solidity
   xDomainCalldataHash = keccak256(
   	abi.encodeWithSignature(
           "relayMessage(address,address,bytes,uint256)",
           _target,
           _sender,
           _message,
           _messageNonce <=== this is "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000999"
       )
   )
   ```
   This will generate a new hash for the migrated legacy withdrawal and bypass the validation check at Line 275 below, and cause the message to be relayed again.

   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L270
   
   ```solidity
   File: CrossDomainMessenger.sol
   270:         // If the message is version 0, then it's a migrated legacy withdrawal. We therefore need
   271:         // to check that the legacy version of the message has not already been relayed.
   272:         if (version == 0) {
   273:             bytes32 oldHash = Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0(_target, _sender, _message, _nonce);
   274:             require(
   275:                 successfulMessages[oldHash] == false,
   276:                 "CrossDomainMessenger: legacy withdrawal already relayed"
   277:             );
   278:         }
   ```


## Impact

High. Loss of assets. This allows anyone who has bridged assets from L2 to L1 before the migration to bridge the assets again for the second time after the migration, effectively resulting in a double-spend bug.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the implementation to compute the old hash of the legacy message by using the legacy-style nonce (without versioning) that contains only the Nonce counter.

```diff
function relayMessage(
    uint256 _nonce,
    address _sender,
    address _target,
    uint256 _value,
    uint256 _minGasLimit,
    bytes calldata _message
) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
+   (uint240 legacyNonce, uint16 version) = Encoding.decodeVersionedNonce(_nonce);
-   (, uint16 version) = Encoding.decodeVersionedNonce(_nonce);
    require(
        version < 2,
        "CrossDomainMessenger: only version 0 or 1 messages are supported at this time"
    );

    // If the message is version 0, then it's a migrated legacy withdrawal. We therefore need
    // to check that the legacy version of the message has not already been relayed.
    if (version == 0) {
+       bytes32 oldHash = Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0(_target, _sender, _message, legacyNonce);
-       bytes32 oldHash = Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0(_target, _sender, _message, _nonce);
        require(
            successfulMessages[oldHash] == false,
