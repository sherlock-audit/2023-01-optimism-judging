# [Medium] Function PreCheckWithdrawals() doesn't uniquify withdrawal items, this may cause double spend parameters like gas limit set differently for those duplicate items

## Summary
Function `PreCheckWithdrawals()` checks that the given list of withdrawals represents all withdrawals made in the legacy system and filters out any extra withdrawals not included in the legacy system but code don't check for duplicate items and it may add single message multiple times. This can be a problem if other parts of the code treat them as different messages. This can cause the deployment script to exit with error or generate suspicious logs that can cause migration to be halted. also double spend may happen if for those message code set different nonce or gas limit for them L2ToL1MessagePasser hash calculation. the list of withdrawals shouldn't have duplicate items after filtering.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `PreCheckWithdrawals()` code:
```go
// PreCheckWithdrawals checks that the given list of withdrawals represents all withdrawals made
// in the legacy system and filters out any extra withdrawals not included in the legacy system.
func PreCheckWithdrawals(db *state.StateDB, withdrawals []*LegacyWithdrawal) ([]*LegacyWithdrawal, error) {
	// Convert each withdrawal into a storage slot, and build a map of those slots.
	slotsInp := make(map[common.Hash]*LegacyWithdrawal)
	for _, wd := range withdrawals {
		slot, err := wd.StorageSlot()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot check withdrawals: %w", err)
		}

		slotsInp[slot] = wd
	}

	// Build a mapping of the slots of all messages actually sent in the legacy system.
	var count int
	slotsAct := make(map[common.Hash]bool)
	err := db.ForEachStorage(predeploys.LegacyMessagePasserAddr, func(key, value common.Hash) bool {
		// When a message is inserted into the LegacyMessagePasser, it is stored with the value
		// of the ABI encoding of "true". Although there should not be any other storage slots, we
		// can safely ignore anything that is not "true".
		if value != abiTrue {
			// Should not happen!
			log.Error("found unknown slot in LegacyMessagePasser", "key", key.String(), "val", value.String())
			return true
		}

		// Slot exists, so add it to the map.
		slotsAct[key] = true
		count++
		return true
	})
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot iterate over LegacyMessagePasser: %w", err)
	}

	// Log the number of messages we found.
	log.Info("Iterated legacy messages", "count", count)

	// Iterate over the list of actual slots and check that we have an input message for each one.
	for slot := range slotsAct {
		_, ok := slotsInp[slot]
		if !ok {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("unknown storage slot in state: %s", slot)
		}
	}

	// Iterate over the list of input messages and check that we have a known slot for each one.
	// We'll filter out any extra messages that are not in the legacy system.
	filtered := make([]*LegacyWithdrawal, 0)
	for slot := range slotsInp {
		_, ok := slotsAct[slot]
		if !ok {
			log.Info("filtering out unknown input message", "slot", slot.String())
			continue
		}

		filtered = append(filtered, slotsInp[slot])
	}

	// At this point, we know that the list of filtered withdrawals MUST be exactly the same as the
	// list of withdrawals in the state. If we didn't have enough withdrawals, we would've errored
	// out, and if we had too many, we would've filtered them out.
	return filtered, nil
}
```
As you can see code checks that all the cross domain messages are included in the withdrawals and only select withdrawals that their hash has been set to true in the LegacyMessagePasserAddr storage. but code don't uniquify the withdrawal list and if the initial list had duplicate items then the final list would have duplicate items too. 
The legacy message in L2CrossDomainMessage includes this information: (Target, Sender, Data and Nonce) and the new withdraw message has this information: (Target, Sender, Data, Nonce, Value, GasLimit). so the parameters (Value, GasLimit) are new and specially parameter GasLimit is set by the deployment script.
The new L2ToL1MessageParser has this information: (Nonce, Sender, Target, Value, Gaslimit, Data) and GasLimit and Value and Nonce are new and set by the deployment script. 
so if `PreCheckWithdrawals()` return duplicate items then function `MigrateWithdrawal()` which is responsible for migrating withdrawal message to new format may create duplicate message for single old message by setting different values for Gaslimit or Nonce in the L2ToL1MessageParser.

## Impact
first impact is that the issue can cause migration to be interrupted as the messages count would be higher than the real amount of the message, and even if the hashed values were equal for duplicate messages and couldn't cause double spend but the bigger number of message would be sign of suspicious withdrawals.
also possible double spend if duplicate message generate different hash because of the added new field to messages that their values calculated by deployment script.
