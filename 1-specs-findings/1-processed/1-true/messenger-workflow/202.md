# messengers: incorrect workflow for message passing


## Summary

In the specs for messengers, it states incorrect workflow for message passing.
It states that the user should call `relayMessage` on the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` but `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will be called by `OptimismPortal`. Only after the `relayMessage` by the `OptimismPortal` should revert, the user can try again by calling the `relayMessage` on the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/specs/messengers.md?plain=1#L59-L61

When going from L2 to L1, the user (or a relayer) calls `OptimismPortal::proveWithdrawalTransaction` to prove and `OptimismPortal::finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` to finalize. The `OptimismPortal::finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` calls the `L1CrossDomainMessenger::relayMessage` function. Only when the `relayMessage` call from the portal should fail, the user (or a relayer) can call the `relayMessage` function again.

## Impact

factually incorrect information

An user who reads the incorrect workflow would misunderstand the workflow of the message passing.
