# slight discrepancy found in using the data range used for `_minGasLimit`

## Summary

In observed in some places contract uses the uint32 data range to take min gas as input.

In most of the places the contract accepts _minGasLimit value as uint32.

But it is not guaranteed that this min gas value is less than uint32.

One example is from `L2ERC721Bridge.sol` contract in `_initiateBridgeERC721` function.

    function _initiateBridgeERC721(
        address _localToken,
        address _remoteToken,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint32 _minGasLimit, -----------observered in audit.
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) 

But the  MESSENGER.sendMessage function takes the Gaslimit as uint64.

    function _sendMessage(
        address _to,
        uint64 _gasLimit,   ------------ observed in audit.
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _data
    ) internal virtual;

under these circumstances, when the min gas value is above the uint32 range , the transaction can not be completed.


## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section.

## Impact

The transaction can not be done due to min gas restriction.

## Tool used

Manual Review. code reading.

## Recommendation

use same data value as uint64 in all the places through out the contract for gas input.
