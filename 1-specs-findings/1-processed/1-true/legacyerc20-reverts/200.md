# Specification Inconsistency in Legacy ERC20 Functions Reverting

## Summary
Documentation says that after Bedrock migration all methods interacting with state on the LegacyERC20 contract will now revert https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/predeploys.md#legacyerc20eth. Functions that changed state were already reverting and view functions are being updated to still work.

## Vulnerability Detail
Just not working as described.

## Impact
Low

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/407f97b9d13448b766624995ec824d3059d4d4f6/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/legacy/LegacyERC20ETH.sol#L35

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove comment about this reverting--maybe change to it saying they're being updated (such as balance using address.balance).
