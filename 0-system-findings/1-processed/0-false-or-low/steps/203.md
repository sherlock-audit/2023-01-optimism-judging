# Critical Address Changes Should Use Two-step Procedure

## Summary
The critical procedures should be a two-step process. OpenZeplin's Ownable.sol used.

## Vulnerability Detail
OpenZepplin's Ownable provides a One-Step process for Transfer Ownership of the contract. Critical Address Changes Should always be Two-step Procedure.

## Impact
The lack of a two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. A One-Step Transfer OwnerShip procedure can fall victim to accidentally inputting the wrong future owner's address, resulting in loss of contract's ownership forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There is another Openzeppelin Ownable contract, [Ownable2Step.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol), which provides a two-step procedure for transfer ownership. `transferOwnership()` & `acceptOwnership()`
