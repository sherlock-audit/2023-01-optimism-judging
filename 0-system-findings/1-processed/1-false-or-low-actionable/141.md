# Revert Messages: 2 inconsistent instances

## Summary

The linked below instances use a different contract name for their revert messages

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ERC721Bridge.sol#L88

No Contract Name
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Bytes.sol#L27-L29

## Vulnerability Detail

Every other instance in the code is prefixed by the exact ContractName, these two do not.

To keep the coding convention you should prefix the revert messages with the Contract Names


## Impact

Minor tracking / Quality control

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the exact contract name to these instances as well
