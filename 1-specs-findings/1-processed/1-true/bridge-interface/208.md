# bridges: incorrect function name for `StandardBridge::OTHER_BRIDGE`


## Summary

The interface of `StandardBridge` in the specs contains the function `otherBridge`, which the `StandardBridge` does not expose, as the `StandardBridge` (and its L1 and L2 children) does not implement the function or does not have a public variable with the name.


## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/specs/bridges.md?plain=1#L39

The function `otherBridge` in the `StandardBridge` interface should be `OTHER_BRIDGE()`, as there is no such function or public variable with the name `otherBridge` in `StandardBridge` or its L1 and L2 children.

## Impact

factually incorrect information (incorrect function name in the interface)

As the incorrect function is provided in the interface of `StandardBridge`, anybody who copies the interface and tries to call on the incorrect function will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either correct the function name in the specs or implement the missing function in the code
