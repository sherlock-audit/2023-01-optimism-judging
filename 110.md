# CrossDomainOwnable.sol and CrossDomainOwnable2.sol lack two-step ownership transfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

CrossDomainOwnable.sol and CrossDomainOwnable2.sol should override the transfer mechanism to a two-step push pull ownership structure, in which the current owner pushes the transfer to the new owner and the new owner must manually pull the ownership to confirm the transfer
