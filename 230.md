# Max fee increase invariant is not respected in ResourceMetering.sol

## Summary
Max fee increase invariant is not respected. As can be seen in `test_meter_useMax_succeeds`, when max resources are used, the fee increases by 3/8 instead of 1/8. Since the fuzzing test with echidna in `FuzzResourceMetering.sol` seems to make the correct check, I suspect the condition `(uint256(params.prevBlockNum) - cachedPrevBlockNum == 1)` to never be true, failing to set `failedMaxRaiseBaseFeePerBlock` to true.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Fee grows faster than expected, and decreases slower than it grows.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adjust as follows:

in ResourceMetering.sol:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L93-L96

Please either change ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER to 2, as in the original proposal: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#gasprice

or adapt in the following way:

```solidity
// Handle updating EIP-1559 style gas parameters. We use EIP-1559 to restrict the rate
// at which deposits can be created and therefore limit the potential for deposits to
// spam the L2 system. Fee scheme is very similar to EIP-1559 with minor changes.
int256 gasUsedDelta = int256(uint256(params.prevBoughtGas)) - TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT;
int256 baseFeeDelta = (int256(uint256(params.prevBaseFee)) * gasUsedDelta) /
    (MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT - TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT) /
    BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR;
```
So the TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT remains unchanged, but max increase of the fee is indeed 1/8 (max decrease becomes 1/24).
