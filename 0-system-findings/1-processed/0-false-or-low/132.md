- [132.md](processed/low/go/132.md): #false
  - **Description:** Unsafe defaults for op-node P2P RPC
  - **Reason:** The P2P port defaults to open but only supports gossip. The RPC service is what exposes functions like `disconnectPeer` and its listen addr must be specified with --rpc.addr.
  - **Action:** None

# Administrative RPCs are not protected

## Summary

Users are, by default, open to their node being disconnected via p2p APIs.

## Vulnerability Detail

The p2p stack is enabled by default, and can be disabled by a flag named `"p2p.disable"`. This flag is not set in any of the configs in the `deploy-config` directory. Users running Optimism nodes are therefore running all p2p APIs in `rpc_server.go`.

The default listen IP is also `0.0.0.0`, which means any IP may connect.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/flags/p2p_flags.go#L44-L50

## Impact

Nodes in the default configuration open themselves up to APIs like `disconnectPeer` and `blockSubnet`, allowing for an attacker to eclipse arbitrary nodes from the network.

Attack scenario:

- call `blockSubnet` with the entire ip space to disallow any new connections to any peers
- enumerate currently connected peers with `peers`
- forcefully disconnect each enumerated peer with `disconnectPeer`

The steps above will disconnect a node from the p2p network.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Do not enable p2p APIs to listen on `0.0.0.0` by default


- Consider setting `Authenticated` to True in `rpcServer.EnableP2P`.
