# Network lag increases with Challenger intervention

## Summary
If challenger deletes a l2Output root which is say 1 day old, then network will start lagging in

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Proposer needs to submit an output everyone 120 seconds (or 60 L2 blocks) 

2. Lets say Proposer submitted output root R1,R2,....RN at l2Outputs indexes x,y,......z on Day 1

```solidity
function proposeL2Output(
        bytes32 _outputRoot,
        uint256 _l2BlockNumber,
        bytes32 _l1BlockHash,
        uint256 _l1BlockNumber
    ) external payable {
	...
	emit OutputProposed(_outputRoot, nextOutputIndex(), _l2BlockNumber, block.timestamp);

        l2Outputs.push(
            Types.OutputProposal({
                outputRoot: _outputRoot,
                timestamp: uint128(block.timestamp),
                l2BlockNumber: uint128(_l2BlockNumber)
            })
        );
    }
```
3. On Day 2, Challenger sees an issue with the output generated by Proposer

4. Challenger stops proposer so that proposer cannot keep on submitting new proposals

5. Challenger uses [deleteL2Outputs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L128) and delete the roots from index x

6. Challenger analysis the issue which caused this, lets say it took 1 day

7. Post 1 day, proposer is resumed

8. Proposer will restart with index x which means it will already be delayed by 2 days in output creation. Since output creation is delayed the withdrawal processing also gets delayed causing a network lag

9. If these issues are frequent then network lag will become large enough impacting the withdrawal timeline

## Impact
Network lag will cause withdrawal delay

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If such a case arrives, proposer should be configurable to catch up the delay by submitting output more frequently
