# withdrawals: finalize and prove are two step process


## Summary
In the explanation of withdrawals, it is falsely stated that finalizing on `OptimismPortal` will prove the inclusion of the withdrawal message. This implies that one step on the L1 chain. However, it is important to notice that it is two step process (prove and finalize) on the L1 chain.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `OptimismPortal::finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` checks whether the transaction's inclusion was proved, but itself does not prove the inclusion, since the proof is performed in the `OptimismPortal::proveWithdrawalTransaction`.
The above implies an one step process on the L1 chain side, namely finalize to prove. However, it is a two step process, namely prove and then finalize.

## Impact
