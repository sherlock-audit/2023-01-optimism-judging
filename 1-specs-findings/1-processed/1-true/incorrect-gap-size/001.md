# Misleading gap size

## Summary
The gap size in the comments and the actual code are different; the size is incorrect in both variants.
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the documentation, the gap's size should equal 44 because there are 6 used storage slots in the contract.
## Impact
This is misleading and could impact future upgrades.
