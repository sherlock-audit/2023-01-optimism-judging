# ERC721 that are also ERC1155 will not work properly with the Bridge.

## Summary

Some tokens that implement both standards can get stuck in the bridge, unable to be withdrawn



## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC721 are also ERC1155, for example [ASSET from Sandbox](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa342f5d851e866e18ff98f351f2c6637f4478db5#readProxyContract)

For which the [implementation of `safeTransferFrom`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fbf5c9af42a6d146dcc18762f515692cd5f853b#code#F2#L856) is a variant of the ERC1155 safeTransferFrom with bytes(0) for data and 1 for amount.

For these tokens, that may have a quantity above 1, the Bridge will misbehave in the following way:

- One token will be bridgeable back and forth correctly.
- If a second token is bridged, the mapping `deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken][_tokenId]` will already be `true` and will remain as such
- Once the first token is bridged back, [the mapping will be toggled to false](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L64-L65)
- This will prevent the second token from being redeemable on mainnet, as the Bridge will assume that the token was already bridged.

## Impact

Each subsequent token that is bridged to L2 will not be withdrawable as the first token withdrawn will set the boolean to false

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L64-L65

```solidity
        deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken][_tokenId] = false;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

One option is to ensure that the tokens do not support ERC1155

The alternative is to warn users about these risks
