  - **Description:** Timeouts aren't set on some HTTP services
  - **Reason:** It is true that we have not set timeouts for some HTTP services. However, the affected services - the op-node RPC, the metrics, and the stateviz endpoint - are not designed to be exposed to the public internet, and are not critical to the functioning of the op-node.

# HTTP services without configured timeouts are vulnerable to Slowloris attacks

## Summary

The rollup node runs multiple HTTP services for various purposes. However, some HTTP services are not configured with a proper timeout and thus vulnerable to a Slowloris attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerable HTTP services are:

- `op-node/node/server.go#L90` (using `http.Server`)
- `op-node/metrics/metrics.go#L505-#L510` (using `http.Server`)
- `op-node/cmd/stateviz/main.go#L164` (using `net/http serve`)

By default, the Go `net/http serve` function and `http.Server` does not have a request timeout, and thus an attacker can send partial request headers very slowly to keep their connections alive for a long period. The attacker opens many such connections, and eventually, the node will fail to accept new requests because there are no more available threads or file descriptors on the server.

## Impact

The attacker can DoS a rollup node with a Slowloris attack. As one of the vulnerable HTTP services is for providing the JSON-RPC APIs, the DoS attack makes the rollup node unable to serve the RPC requests from users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider setting default timeouts for the HTTP services (e.g., `ReadTimeout` and `WriteTimeout` for `http.Server`).
