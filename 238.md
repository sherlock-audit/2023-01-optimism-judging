# Failed pre-bedrock deposits will be unreplayable after migration, and thus be lost

## Summary
Deposits in the form of `xDomainMessage` which have failed in L2 due to a contract or gas failure, will become definitely unreplayable after the migration, causing loss of funds to the users which have deposited.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently if a deposit has failed to execute on L2 due to gas limit or other reasons, a user can try to replay it by calling `replayMessage` on L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol. Since there is no procedure to migrate these unsuccessful deposits to bedrock, these funds will be lost forever for the users after the migration.

## Impact
Some user deposits will be lost forever.

## Recommendation
Please implement a deposit migration, in the same way there is a procedure for migration of withdrawals.
