- [225.md](processed/false/specs/225.md): #false
  - **Description:** Deposit transactions don't return chain ID in ethers.js
  - **Reason:** There's nothing we can do here since Ethers does an ecrecover on the signature to get the chain ID, and there is no signature on deposit transactions. Will require upstream tooling changes to work properly. We should document and move on.

# Incorrect chain id in cross-chain transactions

## Summary
When executing a cross-chain transaction (L1 -> L2) the chain id is "0" in the transaction receipt. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When doing cross chain transactions through the optimism portal, the chain id in the receipt in L2 is "0".  It is expected to have the chain id from the receiving chain. For example, when withdrawing funds (L2 -> L1) the chain id will be always "1".
## Impact
Low, it can affect some tooling and users that depend on the transaction receipt to display or use the information.

POC: 
```js
const proof = async () => {
  const opProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
    "https://goerli.optimism.io"
  );
  const tx = await opProvider.getTransaction(
    "0xfd182b4a98ae0186a4196698ba90324ec7ce9900210224d025beff727ef24481"
  );
  console.log("chain id: ", tx.chainId);
};
```
