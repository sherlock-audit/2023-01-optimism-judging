# After EIP-6049 and EIP-4758, selfdestruct method is now considered deprecated

## Summary

After [EIP-6049](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049) and [EIP-4758](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4758), selfdestruct method is now considered deprecated. [Burn.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Burn.sol) uses the `selfdestruct` method. It's then implemented in [optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol).

## Vulnerability Detail

The opcode SELFDESTRUCT is being deprecated.

## Impact

The contracts that use the `selfdestruct` method may not work as intended.

## Code Snippet

The `selfdestruct` method is called from [optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Burn.sol#L14-L16](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Burn.sol#L14-L16) -> [optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Burn.sol#L38-L42](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Burn.sol#L38-L42)
```Solidity
function eth(uint256 _amount) internal {
    new Burner{ value: _amount }();
}
```
```Solidity
contract Burner {
    constructor() payable {
        selfdestruct(payable(address(this)));
    }
}
```

[Burn.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Burn.sol) is imported by [L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L7):
```Solidity
import { Burn } from "../libraries/Burn.sol";
```

The function `eth` that invokes the method `selfdestruct` is then called by the function `burn()`, which is an important function of the contract, in [optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L85-89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L85-89) with `Burn.eth(balance)`
```Solidity
/**
     * @notice Removes all ETH held by this contract from the state. Used to prevent the amount of
     *         ETH on L2 inflating when ETH is withdrawn. Currently only way to do this is to
     *         create a contract and self-destruct it to itself. Anyone can call this function. Not
     *         incentivized since this function is very cheap.
     */
function burn() external {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    Burn.eth(balance);
    emit WithdrawerBalanceBurnt(balance);
}
```
