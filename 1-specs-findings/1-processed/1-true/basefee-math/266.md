# Specification of the new base fee calculation is inconsistent with the code

## Summary

Specification of the new base fee calculation is inconsistent with the code.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ["Guaranteed Gas Fee Market" specification](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/specs/guaranteed-gas-market.md) provides a pseudocode explaining how a new base fee is calculated, which has two inconsistencies with the actual code implementation:

1. When multiple blocks are skipped, the new base fee is applied with a 7/8 reduction per block. The code uses the updated `newBaseFee` (see `ResourceMetering.sol#L115`) while the specification uses the un-updated `prev_basefee`.
2. The maximum new base fee in the specification is `UINT_64_MAX_VALUE` but is set to `type(uint128).max` in the code.

## Impact

The specification does not match the code.
