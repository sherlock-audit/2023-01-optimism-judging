# Is better to use safeTransferOwnership and two-step procedure for critical operation


## Summary
The transferOwnership function is a delicate process. It could lead to loss of authorization to critical functions in case of typos or bad copy/paste. A two step process should be used as a guard against setting the wrong admin.

## Vulnerability Detail
Also transferOwnership function is used to change Ownership. Use a 2 structure transferOwnership which is safer. safeTransferOwnership, use it is more secure due to 2-stage ownership transfer.

## Impact
The admin is responsible for setting multiple critical operation such as the creation of markets, scheduling withdrawals and so son. Loss of the admin role would therefore lead to breaking of how the protocol works including loss of funds.
