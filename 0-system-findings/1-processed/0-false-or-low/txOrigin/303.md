# Use of tx.origin in OptimismPortal.sol

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In OptimismPortal.sol in the finalizeWithdrawalTransaction(() function tx.origin is used. 
tx.origin is a global variable in Solidity which returns the address of the account that sent the transaction. 

## Impact

Using the variable could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls into a malicious contract.

```solidity
        if (success == false && tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
            revert("OptimismPortal: withdrawal failed");
        }
```
