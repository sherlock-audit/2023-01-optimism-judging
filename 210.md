# Pre-deployed Contract Ether Balance Will Be Doubled in Migration Edge Case

## Summary
During the migration process there's a step that deals with wiping pre-deployed contracts and recreating them, allowing them to be changed into proxies. During this process the code ensures that if the account currently has an Ether balance it is transferred over to the new state object when a new account is created.

However if a state object already has a balance associated with it, when an account is newly created it will already transfer over that balance. This means that the balance is transferred over once, then it is added to again by the migration script, therefore doubling the Ether in the account.

This results in Ether potentially being minted during the migration process, although only in a scenario that's unlikely to happen as the pre-deployed contracts should never have Ether in their database balance at this point.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `CreateAccount` call is made here https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/407f97b9d13448b766624995ec824d3059d4d4f6/op-chain-ops/genesis/setters.go#L99 for the pre-deployed contract. In this call, if the account is not currently empty, its balance is transferred to the new state object https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/985086bf2a5c61e76a8ce7c74ac029660751e260/core/state/statedb.go#L611.

This results in an account that is reset in most ways other than its balance. The migration script then continues to `AddBalance` if the old balance was more than 0 here https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/407f97b9d13448b766624995ec824d3059d4d4f6/op-chain-ops/genesis/setters.go#L104.

This results in a scenario where the old balance successfully transfers over, then is doubled.

## Impact
Medium. It would be very bad if it happened, but it is unlikely to occur.

## Recommendation
Remove the lines where additional balance is added after account is created.
