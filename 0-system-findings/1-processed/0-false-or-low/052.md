# Challenger deleting all the L2 outputs by mistake

## Summary
The `challenger` has the power to deleted the outputs. But, if for any reason, all the outputs are deleted, there will be a large impact on the project because all the deleted outputs should be proposed again by the `proposer`. 
## Vulnerability Detail
If the `challenger` is compromised, or acts maliciously, or by mistake deletes the L2 outputs to a very small value (like zero), all the outputs should be proposed again. 

For example, at the time of writing this issue, the `nextOutputIndex` is 7001. If, the `challenger` calls the function `deleteL2Outputs(0)`, the length of the array `l2Outputs` will be set to zero.

It means that the proposer should call the function `proposeL2Output(...)` 7001 times to sync the blocks on L2 and L1.

## Impact
If the `challenger` makes a mistake or compromised, it can lead to protocol halt, because no withdrawal can be proved and finalized while the array `l2Outputs` has length zero.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a check on the minimum value that the `challenger` can insert in the function `deleteL2Outputs`. For example, if an output is proposed 20 days ago, it should not be allowed to be deleted anymore.
```solidity
function deleteL2Outputs(uint256 _l2OutputIndex) external {
       //...
       require(block.timestamp - l2Outputs[_l2OutputIndex].timestamp < 20 days, "too late to delete");
}
```
