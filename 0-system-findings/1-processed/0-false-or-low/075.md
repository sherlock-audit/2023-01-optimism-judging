  - **Description:** deleteL2Outputs delays finalization
  - **Reason:** This is know and expected behavior. If it did not delay finalization, new outputs would not be subject to the finalization window

# Challenger can override the 7 day finalization period

## Summary
All withdrawals are finalized after a 7 days window (finalization period). After this duration transaction are confirmed and user can surely withdraw their balance.
But due to lack of check, challenger can delete a l2Output which is older than 7 days meaning withdrawals will stop working for even confirmed transaction

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Proposer has proposed L2 output for a _l2BlockNumber which creates entries on l2Outputs using the [proposeL2Output](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L160). Assume this creates a new l2Output at index X

```solidity
l2Outputs.push(
            Types.OutputProposal({
                outputRoot: _outputRoot,
                timestamp: uint128(block.timestamp),
                l2BlockNumber: uint128(_l2BlockNumber)
            })
        );
```

2. [proveWithdrawalTransaction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L160) has been called for user linked to this l2Output

3. Finalization period(7 day) is over after proposal and Users is ready to call `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` to withdraw their funds

4. Since confirmation is done, User A is sure that he will be able to withdraw and thinks to do it after coming back from his holidays

5. Challenger tries to delete the index X (Step 1), ideally it should not be allowed as already confirmed. But since there is no such timeline check so the l2Output gets deleted

```solidity
function deleteL2Outputs(uint256 _l2OutputIndex) external {
        require(
            msg.sender == CHALLENGER,
            "L2OutputOracle: only the challenger address can delete outputs"
        );

        // Make sure we're not *increasing* the length of the array.
        require(
            _l2OutputIndex < l2Outputs.length,
            "L2OutputOracle: cannot delete outputs after the latest output index"
        );

        uint256 prevNextL2OutputIndex = nextOutputIndex();

        // Use assembly to delete the array elements because Solidity doesn't allow it.
        assembly {
            sstore(l2Outputs.slot, _l2OutputIndex)
        }

        emit OutputsDeleted(prevNextL2OutputIndex, _l2OutputIndex);
    }
```

6. User comes back and now tries to withdraw but the withdraw fails since the l2Output index X does not exist anymore. This is incorrect and nullifies the network guarantee.

Note:
In case of a separate output root could be proven then user withdrawal will permanently stuck. Ideally if such anomaly could not be caught within finalization period then user should be allowed to withdraw

## Impact
Withdrawal will fail for confirmed transaction

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add below check in 

```solidity
require(getL2Output(_l2OutputIndex).timestamp<=FINALIZATION_PERIOD_SECONDS, "Output already confirmed");
```
