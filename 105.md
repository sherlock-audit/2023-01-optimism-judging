# Migration can be bricked by sending a message directly to the LegacyMessagePasser

## Summary

The migration process halts and returns an error if any of the withdrawal data breaks from the specified format. However, the data for this migration comes from every call that has been made to the LegacyMessagePasser (0x00) address, and it is possible to send a transaction that would violate the requirements. The result is that the migration process would be bricked and need to be rebuilt, with some difficult technical challenges that we'll outline below.

## Vulnerability Detail

Withdrawal data is saved in l2geth whenever a call is made to the LegacyMessagePasser address:
```go
if addr == dump.MessagePasserAddress {
	statedumper.WriteMessage(caller.Address(), input)
}
```
This will save all the calls that came via the L2CrossDomainMessenger. The expected format for the data is encoded in the L2CrossDomainMessenger. It encodes the calldata to be executed on the L1 side as:
`abi.encodeWithSignature("relayMessage(...)", target, sender, message, nonce)`

The migration process expects the calldata to follow this format, and expects the call to come from L2CrossDomainMessenger, implemented with the following two checks:
```go
selector := crypto.Keccak256([]byte("relayMessage(address,address,bytes,uint256)"))[0:4]
if !bytes.Equal(data[0:4], selector) {
	return fmt.Errorf("invalid selector: 0x%x", data[0:4])
}

msgSender := data[len(data)-len(predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr):]
if !bytes.Equal(msgSender, predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr.Bytes()) {
	return errors.New("invalid msg.sender")
}
```
The migration process wil be exited and the migration will fail if this assumption is violated.

However, since the function on the LegacyMessagePasser is public, it can also be called directly with arbitrary calldata:
```solidity
function passMessageToL1(bytes memory _message) external {
    sentMessages[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_message, msg.sender))] = true;
}
```
This allows us to submit calldata that would violate both of these checks and cause the migration to panic and fail.

While it may seem easy to filter these withdrawals out and rerun the migration, this solution would not work either. That's because, later in the process, we check that easy storage slot in the LegacyMessagePasser contract has a corresponding withdrawal in the migration:
```go
for slot := range slotsAct {
	_, ok := slotsInp[slot]
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("unknown storage slot in state: %s", slot)
	}
}
```
The result is that the Optimism team would need to unwind the migration, develop a new migration process to account for this issue, and remigrate with an untested system.

## Impact

While this attack would not lead to direct loss of funds for users, it would lead to significant challenges for the Optimism team, needing to run a less tested migration process (which could lead to further issues), and a significant amount of FUD in pausing a partially completed migration partway through.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rather than throwing an error if withdrawal data doesn't meet the requirements, save a list of these withdrawals and continue. Include this list when prechecking withdrawals to ensure that they are included in the storage slot matching process, but not included in withdrawals to be transferred to the new system.
