# Unprotected selfdestruct Instruction

## Summary

Unprotected selfdestruct Instruction

## Vulnerability Detail

A contract can be terminated, its bytecode removed from the Ethereum blockchain, and its money sent to a particular address by using the selfdestruct keyword.

If not properly protected, malicious parties have the ability to self-destruct the contract due to missing or inadequate access controls.

## Impact

Malicious parties have the ability to self-destruct the contract due to missing or inadequate access controls.

## Code Snippet

[optimism/integration-tests/contracts/SelfDestruction.sol#L11-L14](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/integration-tests/contracts/SelfDestruction.sol#L11-L14)
```Solidity
function destruct() public {
        address payable self = payable(address(this));
        selfdestruct(self);
    }
```

## Tool used

- Private self-made tool for static analysis
- Manual Review, Remix IDE

## Recommendation

It is advised to construct a multisig scheme if there is a legitimate use-case such that many parties must consent to the self-destruct operation.
