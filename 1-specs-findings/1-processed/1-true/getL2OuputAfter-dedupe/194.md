# Specs incorrectly describes the input needed for proving and verifying withdrawals

## Summary

The withdrawals spec incorrectly describes what inputs are required to prove and finalize a withdrawal in `OptimismPortal`
It describes that the `l2BlockNumber` is needed in order to prove while `_l2OutputIndex` is needed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The spec writes:

```markdown
- Proof and verification data:
  - `l2BlockNumber`: The L2 block number that corresponds to the output root.
  - `outputRootProof`: Four `bytes32` values which are used to derive the output root.
  - `withdrawalProof`: An inclusion proof for the given withdrawal in the L2ToL1MessagePasser contract.
These inputs must satisfy the following conditions:
1. The `l2BlockNumber` must be the block number that corresponds to the `OutputProposal` being proven.
1. `L2OutputOracle.getL2OutputAfter(l2BlockNumber)` returns a non-zero `OutputProposal`.
```

`l2BlockNumber` is not needed. The `_l2OutputIndex` is needed:

Additionally, some comments in the code is also incorrectly specifying block number instead of index:

## Impact

Confusion, incorrect.

## Recommendation

Replace `l2BlockNumber` with output index
