# Sanity check at the `constructor` and `initialize()`

## Summary
Adequate zero address and zero value checks should be implemented at the constructor to avoid accidental error(s) particularly when assigning input values to immutable variables. The same shall apply to `initialize()` with an `initializer` visibility.

## Vulnerability Detail
In L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol, `PORTAL`, an immutable instance, is assigned a value without a zero address check. Similarly, `_transferOwnership(_owner)` that is going to be executed once is run without a sanity check for `_owner`. 

## Impact
If zero addresses were entered/entailed in the parameters, it could lead to non-functional calls associated with the errors committed and force redeployment of contracts.

## Code Snippet
[File: L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L27-L43](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L27-L43)

```solidity
    constructor(OptimismPortal _portal)
        Semver(1, 0, 0)
        CrossDomainMessenger(Predeploys.L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER)
    {
        PORTAL = _portal;
        initialize(address(0));
    }

    function initialize(address _owner) public initializer {
        __CrossDomainMessenger_init();
        _transferOwnership(_owner);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider adding checks for zero value/address input errors.
