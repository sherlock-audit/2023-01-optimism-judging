# Incompatible with Deflationary and Rebasing Tokens

## Summary

The `StandardBridge` contract keeps track of token balance in the `deposits` mapping, and increment / decrement token balance based on user input `_amount`, instead of measuring the change in the contract's actual token balance. There can be discrepancy between them for deflationary and rebasing tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When transferring deflationary ERC20 tokens, the input amount may not be equal to the received amount due to the charged transaction fee.For example, if a user sends 100 deflationary tokens (with a 10% transaction fee) to the bridge contract, the token balance of the bridge only increments by 90, when the `deposits` mapping increments the amount by 100. This inconsistency between actual balance and the bridge contract's internal accounting balance will cause some user transactions to fail due to insufficient balance at time of withdrawal. 

Similarly, rebasing tokens might see their balance increase over time. The bridge contract does not provide a way to accurately capture the changing token balance, which could result in some token balance being permanently trapped in the bridge contract. 

## Impact

Some legit user transactions could revert, and some tokens might be permanently stuck in the bridge contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Measure the change in token balance after token transfer, instead of using the amount being transferred in updating the `deposits` mapping.
