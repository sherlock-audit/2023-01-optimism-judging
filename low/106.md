# Deposits are not guaranteed to be reflected within sequencing window

## Summary

There is an inconsistency between the spec and the code regarding guarantees for deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the spec, it states:

> Deposits are guaranteed to be reflected in the L2 state within the sequencing window.

However, until fraud proofs are implemented, there are no guarantees that this will actually be the case.

## Impact

Users may expect that there are guarantees in the system that ensure their deposits will be processed within a given number of blocks, but these guarantees do not exist yet.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove this language from the spec until fraud proofs are live.
