# Gas left check estimation is not accurate

## Summary

Gas left check estimation is not accurate

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, gasleft() check is used to ensure that function call has enough gas left to finish the call:

In OptimismPortal finalizeWithdrawalTransaction function

```solidity
// We want to maintain the property that the amount of gas supplied to the call to the
// target contract is at least the gas limit specified by the user. We can do this by
// enforcing that, at this point in time, we still have gaslimit + buffer gas available.
require(
	gasleft() >= _tx.gasLimit + FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,
	"OptimismPortal: insufficient gas to finalize withdrawal"
);

// Set the l2Sender so contracts know who triggered this withdrawal on L2.
l2Sender = _tx.sender;

// Trigger the call to the target contract. We use SafeCall because we don't
// care about the returndata and we don't want target contracts to be able to force this
// call to run out of gas via a returndata bomb.
bool success = SafeCall.call(
	_tx.target,
	gasleft() - FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,
	_tx.value,
	_tx.data
);
```

and in CrossDomainMessenger.sol

```solidity
	require(
		gasleft() >= _minGasLimit + RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED,
		"CrossDomainMessenger: insufficient gas to relay message"
	);

	xDomainMsgSender = _sender;
	bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_GAS_BUFFER, _value, _message);
	xDomainMsgSender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;

	if (success == true) {
		successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
		emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
	} else {
		failedMessages[versionedHash] = true;
		emit FailedRelayedMessage(versionedHash);

		// Revert in this case if the transaction was triggered by the estimation address. This
		// should only be possible during gas estimation or we have bigger problems. Reverting
		// here will make the behavior of gas estimation change such that the gas limit
		// computed will be the amount required to relay the message, even if that amount is
		// greater than the minimum gas limit specified by the user.
		if (tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
			revert("CrossDomainMessenger: failed to relay message");
		}
	}
```

In both code above, 

first 

```solidity
gasleft() >= _minGasLimit + THRESHOLD,
```

is called, then external call is performed.

The RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED and FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER is used to reserve that function call is completed.

However, the RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED and FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER is hardcoded 

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Minimum amount of gas required to relay a message.
 */
uint256 internal constant RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED = 45_000;
```

and

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Additional gas reserved for clean up after finalizing a transaction withdrawal.
 */
uint256 internal constant FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER = 20_000;
```

However, hardcode the gas cost is always risky because the ethereum opcode gas change can change.

Just like the change of SLOAD operation breaks smart contract

> It looks like EIP 1884 is headed our way in the Istanbul hard fork. This change increases the gas cost of the SLOAD operation and therefore breaks some existing smart contracts.

> Those contracts will break because their fallback functions used to consume less than 2300 gas, and they’ll now consume more. Why is 2300 gas significant? It’s the amount of gas a contract’s fallback function receives if it’s called via Solidity’s transfer() or send() methods. 1

And the gasleft() check if subject to 1/64 rule:

the actual amount of gas left during the external call is less than the reported gasleft() (mainly due to the 1/64 rule, see below), thus the external call has less gas available and the check overesmiate the required the gas to complete the transaction.

Reference for the 1/64 rule - EIP-150.

## Impact

the actual amount of gas left during the external call is less than the reported gasleft() (mainly due to the 1/64 rule, see below), thus the external call has less gas available and the check overesmiate the required the gas to complete the transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol avoid hardcoding the required gas to complete the operation and avoid using gasLeft() to esimtate the gas needed to perform the call.
