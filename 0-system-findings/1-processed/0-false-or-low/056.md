  - **Description:** Bridge should not use safeTransferFrom to send ERC721s, because the recipient might not implement _checkOnERC721Received
  - **Reason:** Can't prevent all possible user errors. In either case it's stuck — either in the contract that receives it but can't use it, or in the bridge

# Using TransferFrom on ERC721 tokens

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
In the function '_initiateBridgeERC721' of contract `L1ERC721Bridge`,  the transferFrom keyword is used instead of safeTransferFrom. The sent tokens could be locked if any user is in a contract and is unaware of incoming ERC721 tokens.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L101

                         'IERC721(_localToken).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _tokenId);'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing transferFrom to safeTransferFrom at line 101.
