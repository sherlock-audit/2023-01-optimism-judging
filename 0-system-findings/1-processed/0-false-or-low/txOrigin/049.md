# AVOID USING TX.ORIGIN

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
`tx.origin` is a global variable in Solidity that returns the address of the account that sent the transaction.

Using the variable could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls a malicious contract. You can impersonate a user using a third party contract.

This can make it easier to create a vault on behalf of another user with an external administrator (by receiving it as an argument).
