# Lack of zero-address check in the constructor of `BaseFeeVault.sol`

## Summary
Accidentaly setting the recipient to `address(0)` will lead to lose of 10 ether

## Vulnerability Detail
The `BaseFeeVault.sol` contract does not sanitize with `address(0)` check in its constructor and this might lead to losing of 10 ether.

## Impact
10 ether might be lost in case the recipient is accidentally set to `address(0)`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest adding a zero address check in the constructor such as:
`require(_recipient != address(0))`
