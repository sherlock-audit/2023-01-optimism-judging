# Initialize function no initializer modifier

## Summary
Initialize function in [L1StandardBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol#L51) no initializer modifier and can be invoked multiple times from the implementation contract. This means a compromised implementation can reinitialize the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Usually in Upgradeable contract, a initialize function is protected by the modifier `initializer` to make sure the contract can only be initialized once.

## Impact
A malicious user can take advantage of the lack of `initializer` modifier and reinitialize the contract.

## Code Snippet
[L1StandardBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol#L51) 

```solidity
51: function initialize(address _l1messenger, address _l2TokenBridge) public {
52:        require(messenger == address(0), "Contract has already been initialized.");
53:        messenger = _l1messenger;
54:        l2TokenBridge = _l2TokenBridge;
55:    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to protect the initialize function from being reinitiated.
```solidity
51: function initialize(address _l1messenger, address _l2TokenBridge) public initializer {
```

Use the initializer modifier to protect the function from being reinitiated.
