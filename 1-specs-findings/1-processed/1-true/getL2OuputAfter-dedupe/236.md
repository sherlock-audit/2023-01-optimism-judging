# `outputRoot` is retrieved from `getL2Output` not `getL2OutputAfter`

## Summary
 
The `Withdrawals` specification wrongfully states that `outputRoot` is retrieved from `getL2OutputAfter` instead of the correct `getL2Output` 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Withdrawals` specification wrongfully states that:

"The OptimismPortal contract retrieves the output root for the given block number from the L2OutputOracle's getL2OutputAfter() function, and performs the remainder of the verification process internally."

Instead, it is retrieved from `getL2Output`:

```solidity
    function proveWithdrawalTransaction(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
        uint256 _l2OutputIndex,
        Types.OutputRootProof calldata _outputRootProof,
        bytes[] calldata _withdrawalProof
    ) external {
        // Prevent users from creating a deposit transaction where this address is the message
        // sender on L2. Because this is checked here, we do not need to check again in
        // `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`.
        require(
            _tx.target != address(this),
            "OptimismPortal: you cannot send messages to the portal contract"
        );

        // Get the output root and load onto the stack to prevent multiple mloads. This will
        // revert if there is no output root for the given block number.
        bytes32 outputRoot = L2_ORACLE.getL2Output(_l2OutputIndex).outputRoot;
```

It should be noted that the misleading specification is used more that once in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/withdrawals.md - "L2OutputOracle.getL2OutputAfter(l2BlockNumber) returns a non-zero OutputProposal."

## Impact

Misleading `Withdrawals` specification.

## Recommendation

Change the `Withdrawals` specification to:

"The `OptimismPortal` contract retrieves the output root for the given block number from the `L2OutputOracle's` `getL2Output()` function, and performs the remainder of the verification process internally."
