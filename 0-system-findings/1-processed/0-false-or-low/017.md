## Impact
This owner variable is used for access control and since it was not initialize all calls to the function using the access modifier would revert.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
address public owner;
modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Function can only be called by the owner of this contract.");
        _;
    }
function setOwner(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize the owner variable in the constructor.
