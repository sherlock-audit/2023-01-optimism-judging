# Node validation queue can be taken over by a single peer

## Summary

Nodes can be clogged with directed spam due to very low resource limits.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `p2p/gossip.go` the p2p resource limits are set as such:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/p2p/gossip.go#L27-L38

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/p2p/gossip.go#L387-L391

The p2p block validation queue is limited to 256 items and the concurrency is set to 4(!). The default concurrency set by the p2p library is 1024.

The main issue here is that the 256-block validation queue is global instead of a small per-peer queue. When the queue is full, any new blocks will not be accepted.

## Impact

Attackers may throttle nodes with spam in the p2p layer. In the worst case they may cause a node to reject valid blocks due to spam.

## Recommendation

Add a per-peer queue to the p2p rate limiting logic. Alternatively, consider increasing concurrent throughput.
