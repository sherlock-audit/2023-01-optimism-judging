# [Medium] If native ERC20 token upgrades its contract to support IOptimismMintableERC20 then users can't bridge back their old bridged tokens

## Summary
Contract StandardBridge is for bridging ERC20 tokens between L1 and L2 network. it supports 4 type of token bridge pairs (Native L1<-> Mintable L2) and (Mintable L1 <-> Native L2) and (Native L1 <-> Native L2) and (Mintable L1 <-> Mintable L2). if a native token developers which has multiple OptimisimMintable token in other network, decides to upgrade their token contract to support IOptimisimMintableERC20 then users can't bridge back their old bridged tokens. there is no formal and clear doc to specify how developers or users should use this bridge and bridge allows all type of transfers so it's possible for protocol to make their token compatible with Optimism bridge and in doing so make users to lose their tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `finalizeBridgeERC20()` code in StandardBridge contract:
```javascript
    function finalizeBridgeERC20(
        address _localToken,
        address _remoteToken,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) public onlyOtherBridge {
        if (_isOptimismMintableERC20(_localToken)) {
            require(
                _isCorrectTokenPair(_localToken, _remoteToken),
                "StandardBridge: wrong remote token for Optimism Mintable ERC20 local token"
            );

            OptimismMintableERC20(_localToken).mint(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] - _amount;
            IERC20(_localToken).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }

        emit ERC20BridgeFinalized(_localToken, _remoteToken, _from, _to, _amount, _extraData);
    }
```
As you can see when token is OptimismMintableERC20 then contract checks that remote token and local token is correct pair. This can cause problem if a native token was bridging to multiple token in the other chain and then the native token get upgraded to support OptimisimMintable interface. here is the POC:
1. There is L1 native token TOKENA(for example USDT).
2. users(projects) created two OptimisimMintable TOKENB and TOKENC in the L2 which `TOKENB.l1Token()` and `TOKENC.l1Token()` returns TOKENA. (for example two project in L2 wants to have their local USDT token in L2).
3. USER1 bridged 1000 TOKENA tokens from L1 to TOKENB in L2 and contract would set `deposits[TOKENA][TOKENB] = 1000`.
4. USER2 bridged 2000 TOKENA tokens from L1 to TOKENC in L2 and contract would set `deposits[TOKENA][TOKENC] = 1000`.
5. right now both USER1 and USER2 can bridge back their tokens to the L1 and burn their tokens in the L2 and receive TOKENA in L1.
6. if TOKENA project decides to upgrade TOKENA to support IOptimisimMintable and set the value of the `TOKENA.l1Token()` to TOKEND then StandardBridge would allow only bridging between TOKENA and TOKEND and USER1 and USER2 can't bridge back their TOKENB and TOKENC tokens from L2 to L1 and receive TOKENA.
7. any user who bridged back their TOKENB or TOKENC from L2 to L1 and didn't yet withdraw their tokens in the L1 would loss their tokens as the withdrawal transaction would revert always.

in this scenario users didn't do anything wrong and bridged native token to mintable tokens. token's project just upgraded their tokens to support Optimism bridge better and didn't do anything wrong as bridge support mintable token to mintable token bridge. but as result some users lost their bridged tokens in the middle of the bridging and other won't able to bridge back their tokens and all bridged tokens would stuck in StandardBridge forever.

## Impact
Users who bridged their native tokens successfully can't bridge back their tokens from other network and native tokens would be locked up in the bridge forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
if local and remote token is not correct pair check for the value of the deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken]. so the code be something like this:
```javascript
        if (_isOptimismMintableERC20(_localToken) &&  _isCorrectTokenPair(_localToken, _remoteToken)) {
            OptimismMintableERC20(_localToken).mint(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] - _amount;
            IERC20(_localToken).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }
```
This way code would support old bridged tokens that increased `deposits[][]` even after native token upgrade.
