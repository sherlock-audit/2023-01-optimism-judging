# Block number is not an input to `proveWithdrawalTransaction` in `OptimismPortal`

## Summary

According to the `Withdrawals` spec, a block number is one of the submitted inputs to the `OptimismPortal` which is not the case.

## Vulnerability Detail

The documentation says: 

"A [relayer](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/glossary.md#withdrawals) submits the required inputs to the OptimismPortal contract. The relayer need not be the same entity which initiated the withdrawal on L2. These inputs include the withdrawal transaction data, inclusion proofs, and a block number. The block number must be one for which an L2 output root exists, which commits to the withdrawal as registered on L2."

In the contract, the `_l2OutputIndex` is the one used to check for existence of the `outputRoot` and not the block number.

```solidity
   function proveWithdrawalTransaction(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
        uint256 _l2OutputIndex,
        Types.OutputRootProof calldata _outputRootProof,
        bytes[] calldata _withdrawalProof
    ) external {
        // Prevent users from creating a deposit transaction where this address is the message
        // sender on L2. Because this is checked here, we do not need to check again in
        // `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`.
        require(
            _tx.target != address(this),
            "OptimismPortal: you cannot send messages to the portal contract"
        );

        // Get the output root and load onto the stack to prevent multiple mloads. This will
        // revert if there is no output root for the given block number.
        bytes32 outputRoot = L2_ORACLE.getL2Output(_l2OutputIndex).outputRoot;

        // Verify that the output root can be generated with the elements in the proof.
        require(
            outputRoot == Hashing.hashOutputRootProof(_outputRootProof),
            "OptimismPortal: invalid output root proof"
        );
```

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The specification should refer to `_l2OutputIndex` as one of the inputs instead of 'block number'.
