# Specification Inconsistency in Legacy Balance Deletion

## Summary
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/1214d4861f41f3391d559792b51f58dea32b3da1/op-chain-ops/genesis/db_migration.go#L194 says that legacy balances are not deleted from the contract during migration.

When it actually migrates, however, state is set to empty, therefore deleting the balances. https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/1214d4861f41f3391d559792b51f58dea32b3da1/op-chain-ops/ether/migrate.go#L66

Either change the wording here or change the code so it doesn't delete the balances.
