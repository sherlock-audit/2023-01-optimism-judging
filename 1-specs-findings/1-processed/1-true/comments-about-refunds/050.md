# Bridging L2 native ERC721s are lost forever, contrary to comment

## Summary
Bridging L2 native ERC721s are lost forever, contrary to dev comment.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `L2ERC721Bridge` has this comment:

```solidity
**WARNING**: Do not bridge an ERC721 that was originally deployed on Optimism. This
 *         bridge ONLY supports ERC721s originally deployed on Ethereum. Users will need to
 *         wait for the one-week challenge period to elapse before their Optimism-native NFT
 *         can be refunded on L2.
 */
```

However, there does not seem to be any kind of "one-week challenge period" in the contract or any way to refund native L2 NFTs.

## Impact
Native L2 tokens most likely cannot be bridged because they don't implement the `IOptimismMintableERC721` interface with the `remoteToken()` function, but this comment gives a wrong sense of security for users that they could indeed be refunded if their L2 native NFT ends up in the bridge contract.
