# The spec contains a number of outdated contract and function names

## Summary

Throughout the spec, there are still many references to old contract and function names, which do not reflect the current Bedrock system.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Overview section of the spec:

- The `L1Components` section says `DepositFeed` instead of `OptimismPortal`
- The `Key Interactions In Depth` section says `DepositFeed` instead of `OptimismPortal`

In the Withdrawals section of the spec:

- The `On L1` section says it interacts with the `getL2OutputAfter()` function, but it’s actually `getL2Output()`. 
- The `WithdrawalVerification` section says it interacts with the `getL2OutputAfter()` function, but it’s actually `getL2Output()`.
- The `OptimismPortal` section says: “The Optimism Portal... is a contract which inherits from the DepositFeed contract...” but it doesn't actually inherit at all.

## Impact

The spec contains a number of outdated contract and function names, which may confuse users and reflects badly on Optimism's professionalism.
