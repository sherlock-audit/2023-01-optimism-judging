  - **Description:** Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for outgoing erc721 transfers
  - **Reason:** This is an incoming not outgoing transfer, and we know that the Bridge is able to accept ERC721s

# For ERC721 transfers, use `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()`

## Summary
The ` _initiateBridgeERC721` function uses the `transferFrom()` method instead of `safeTransferFrom()` when transferring `ERC721`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Instead of using `safeTransferFrom()`, the ` _initiateBridgeERC721` function uses the `transferFrom()` method. But the documentation of OpenZeppelin discourages the usage of `transferFrom()`, instead use `safeTransferFrom()` wherever possible.

## Impact
If the recipient isn't capable of receiving ERC721 then there NFTs may be permanently lost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call the `safeTransferFrom()` method instead of `transferFrom()` for NFT transfers.
