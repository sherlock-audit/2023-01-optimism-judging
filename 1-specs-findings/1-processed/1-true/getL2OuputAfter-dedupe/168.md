# withdrawals: `proveWithdrawalTransaction` takes output index, not the block number


## Summary

In the specs, it is repeatedly stated that `OptimismPortal::proveWithdrawalTransaction` function takes as an input parameter the **block number** of the block, which contains the L2 output root to prove against. However, the `proveWithdrawalTransaction` function takes the **L2 output index** of the block to prove against. The specs also mentions the incorrect functions to be used in the process, namely `getL2OutputAfter`, instead of the function `getL2Output`, which is called in the actual code.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/specs/withdrawals.md?plain=1#L64-L65

In the snippet above states that the block number is given to the `OptimismPortal::proveWithdrawalTransaction`. However, it is actually `_l2OutputIndex`, which is the L2 output index to prove against as from the actual code of `OptimismPortal` below:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L152-L165

The same is in the interface in the specs below:
(Although the name of the parameter does not matter in the interface, who tries to use the interface will be confused.)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/specs/withdrawals.md?plain=1#L147-L152


Below, in the withdrawal flow, it is stating the incorrect function `getL2OutputAfter`. As the L2 output index is given, the `OptimismPortal` will call `getL2Output` with the given L2 Output index.

In the code of `OptimismPortal`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L173-L176

Here, the inputs to prove and finalize a withdrawal is incorrectly stated:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/specs/withdrawals.md?plain=1#L171-L179

Line 172 and 178: should be `l2OutputIndex`, not `l2BlockNumber`
line 179: instead of `L2OutputOracle.getL2OutputAfter(l2BlockNumber)`, it should be `L2OutputOracle.getL2Output(l2OutputIndex)`.
The `l2OutputIndex` should be already proposed (and not cancelled). If the given index output is not yet proposed (or cancelled), the `getL2Output` will revert.


## Impact

factually incorrect information (incorrect input for a function)

As anybody can call the `OptimismPortal::proveWithdrawalTransaction`, whoever tries to call the function with the input information provided in the specs will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

correct the input parameter `l2BlockNumber` to `l2OutputIndex`.
also correct the function in the flow from `getL2OutputAfter` to `getL2Output`
