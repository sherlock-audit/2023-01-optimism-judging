# Malicious Withdrawals Might Be Migrated

## Summary

Malicious withdrawals might be migrated, which allows arbitrary messages to be relayed, leading to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

#### Section 1 - About State Dump File

In pre-bedrock, when someone calls `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function, the following `Call` function in the `evm.go` will be triggered. Then, the caller address and transaction data will be written to the state dump file at Line 208.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/l2geth/core/vm/evm.go#L202

```go
File: evm.go
202: // Call executes the contract associated with the addr with the given input as
203: // parameters. It also handles any necessary value transfer required and takes
204: // the necessary steps to create accounts and reverses the state in case of an
205: // execution error or failed value transfer.
206: func (evm *EVM) Call(caller ContractRef, addr common.Address, input []byte, gas uint64, value *big.Int) (ret []byte, leftOverGas uint64, err error) {
207: 	if addr == dump.MessagePasserAddress {
208: 		statedumper.WriteMessage(caller.Address(), input)
209: 	}
```

The following new line consists of the caller address (sender) and transaction data (msg) will be added to the state dump file located at `L2GETH_STATE_DUMP_PATH` environment variable.

```json
MSG|<sender>|<msg>
```

#### Section 2 - Converting State Dump File To JSON Files (evm-messages.json)

Before the migration, the following script will be executed to parse the state dump files and generate the `evm-messages.json` migration data.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/migration-data/bin/cli.ts#L17

```typescript
File: cli.ts
17: program
18:   .command('parse-state-dump')
19:   .description('parses state dump to json')
20:   .option('--file <file>', 'path to state dump file')
21:   .action(async (options) => {
22:     const iface = getContractInterface('OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser')
23:     const dump = fs.readFileSync(options.file, 'utf-8')
24: 
25:     const addrs: string[] = []
26:     const msgs: any[] = []
27:     for (const line of dump.split('\n')) {
28:       if (line.startsWith('ETH')) {
29:         addrs.push(line.split('|')[1].replace('\r', ''))
30:       } else if (line.startsWith('MSG')) {
31:         const msg = '0x' + line.split('|')[2].replace('\r', '')
32:         const parsed = iface.decodeFunctionData('passMessageToL1', msg)
33:         msgs.push({
34:           who: line.split('|')[1],
35:           msg: parsed._message,
36:         })
37:       }
38:     }
39: 
40:     fs.writeFileSync(
41:       './data/evm-addresses.json',
42:       JSON.stringify(addrs, null, 2)
43:     )
44:     fs.writeFileSync('./data/evm-messages.json', JSON.stringify(msgs, null, 2))
45:   })
```

The generated `evm-messages.json` JSON file will have the following format:

```json
{
    "who": "<caller address>",
    "msg": "<transaction data>"
},
{
    "who": "<caller address>",
    "msg": "<transaction data>"
}
```

#### Section 3 - Converting JSON files to migration data (ovmMessages, evmMessages)

During the migration, the `evm-messages.json` JSON file will be loaded, unmarshalled, and stored in the `evmMessages` migration data variable.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/genesis/migration_action/action.go#L30

```go
File: action.go
30: func Migrate(cfg *Config) (*genesis.MigrationResult, error) {
31: 	deployConfig := cfg.DeployConfig
..SNIP..
45: 	ovmMessages, err := migration.NewSentMessage(cfg.OVMMessagesPath)
46: 	if err != nil {
47: 		return nil, err
48: 	}
49: 	evmMessages, err := migration.NewSentMessage(cfg.EVMMessagesPath)
50: 	if err != nil {
51: 		return nil, err
52: 	}
53: 
54: 	migrationData := migration.MigrationData{
55: 		OvmAddresses:  ovmAddresses,
56: 		EvmAddresses:  evmAddresess,
57: 		OvmAllowances: ovmAllowances,
58: 		OvmMessages:   ovmMessages,
59: 		EvmMessages:   evmMessages,
60: 	}
..SNIP..
85: 	return genesis.MigrateDB(ldb, deployConfig, block, &migrationData, !cfg.DryRun, cfg.NoCheck)
86: }
```

#### Section 4 - Performing migration process

During the migration, the legacy withdrawals from the legacy `LegacyMessagePasser` contract will be migrated to their new format in the Bedrock `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract via the `crossdomain.MigrateWithdrawals` function at Line 188.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/genesis/db_migration.go#L187

```go
File: db_migration.go
183: 	// Now we migrate legacy withdrawals from the LegacyMessagePasser contract to their new format
184: 	// in the Bedrock L2ToL1MessagePasser contract. Note that we do NOT delete the withdrawals from
185: 	// the LegacyMessagePasser contract. Here we operate on the list of withdrawals that we
186: 	// previously filtered and verified.
187: 	log.Info("Starting to migrate withdrawals", "no-check", noCheck)
188: 	err = crossdomain.MigrateWithdrawals(filteredWithdrawals, db, &config.L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy, noCheck)
```

The `MigrateWithdrawal` function below is responsible for turning a legacy withdrawal into a bedrock-style withdrawal. An important point to note here is that the new bedrock style withdrawal is created with the `sender` hardcoded to `&predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr` and the `target` hardcoded as `l1CrossDomainMessenger` as per Line 90-91 below. 

Therefore, the original  `sender` and `target` in the legacy withdrawal will be discarded and replaced with the `&predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr` and `l1CrossDomainMessenger` respectively. As a result, anyone can submit a legacy withdrawal before the migration and the system will consider it originated from `L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr`, thus providing an opportunity for malicious users to perform spoofing attacks. This is the root cause of the issue discussed later.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/crossdomain/migrate.go#L54

```go
File: migrate.go
52: // MigrateWithdrawal will turn a LegacyWithdrawal into a bedrock
53: // style Withdrawal.
54: func MigrateWithdrawal(withdrawal *LegacyWithdrawal, l1CrossDomainMessenger *common.Address) (*Withdrawal, error) {
..SNIP..
66: 	// Migrated withdrawals are specified as version 0. Both the
67: 	// L2ToL1MessagePasser and the CrossDomainMessenger use the same
68: 	// versioning scheme. Both should be set to version 0
69: 	versionedNonce := EncodeVersionedNonce(withdrawal.Nonce, new(big.Int))
70: 	// Encode the call to `relayMessage` on the `CrossDomainMessenger`.
71: 	// The minGasLimit can safely be 0 here.
72: 	data, err := abi.Pack(
73: 		"relayMessage",
74: 		versionedNonce,
75: 		withdrawal.Sender,
76: 		withdrawal.Target,
77: 		value,
78: 		new(big.Int),
79: 		withdrawal.Data,
80: 	)
..SNIP..
88: 	w := NewWithdrawal(
89: 		versionedNonce,
90: 		&predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr,
91: 		l1CrossDomainMessenger,
92: 		value,
93: 		new(big.Int).SetUint64(gasLimit),
94: 		data,
95: 	)
96: 	return w, nil
97: }
```

After converting the legacy withdrawal into a bedrock-style withdrawal, it will be inserted into the storage of Bedrock's `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract. This will ensure that the relayers can prove the withdrawal via the `OptimismPortal.proveWithdrawalTransaction` after the migration.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-chain-ops/crossdomain/migrate.go#L22

```go
File: migrate.go
21: // MigrateWithdrawals will migrate a list of pending withdrawals given a StateDB.
22: func MigrateWithdrawals(withdrawals []*LegacyWithdrawal, db vm.StateDB, l1CrossDomainMessenger *common.Address, noCheck bool) error {
23: 	for i, legacy := range withdrawals {
24: 		legacySlot, err := legacy.StorageSlot()
..SNIP..
29: 		if !noCheck {
30: 			legacyValue := db.GetState(predeploys.LegacyMessagePasserAddr, legacySlot)
31: 			if legacyValue != abiTrue {
32: 				return fmt.Errorf("%w: %s", errLegacyStorageSlotNotFound, legacySlot)
33: 			}
34: 		}
35: 
36: 		withdrawal, err := MigrateWithdrawal(legacy, l1CrossDomainMessenger)
..SNIP..
41: 		slot, err := withdrawal.StorageSlot()
..SNIP..
46: 		db.SetState(predeploys.L2ToL1MessagePasserAddr, slot, abiTrue)
47: 		log.Info("Migrated withdrawal", "number", i, "slot", slot)
48: 	}
49: 	return nil
50: }
```

#### Section 5 - Permissionless `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function

Before the migration (pre-bedrock), anyone can call the `passMessageToL1` function within the Message Passer Contract (OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser) to submit a withdrawal. The transaction data (_message) and the caller address (msg.sender) will be encoded and hashed to produce a key for the `sentMessages` mapping.

As mentioned in the comments, there is a mechanism within the legacy `L1CrossDomainMessenger._verifyStorageProof()` contract to ensure that only messages sent from `L2CrossDomainMessenger` will be relayed before the migration (pre-bedrock). An important point to note is that this mechanism is no longer used in bedrock after the migration.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/predeploys/OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol#L29

```solidity
File: OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.sol
07: /**
08:  * @title OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser
09:  * @dev The L2 to L1 Message Passer is a utility contract which facilitate an L1 proof of the
10:  * of a message on L2. The L1 Cross Domain Messenger performs this proof in its
11:  * _verifyStorageProof function, which verifies the existence of the transaction hash in this
12:  * contract's `sentMessages` mapping.
13:  */
14: contract OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser is iOVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser {
15:     /**********************
16:      * Contract Variables *
17:      **********************/
18: 
19:     mapping(bytes32 => bool) public sentMessages;
20: 
21:     /********************
22:      * Public Functions *
23:      ********************/
24: 
25:     /**
26:      * @inheritdoc iOVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser
27:      */
28:     // slither-disable-next-line external-function
29:     function passMessageToL1(bytes memory _message) public {
30:         // Note: although this function is public, only messages sent from the
31:         // L2CrossDomainMessenger will be relayed by the L1CrossDomainMessenger.
32:         // This is enforced by a check in L1CrossDomainMessenger._verifyStorageProof().
33:         sentMessages[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_message, msg.sender))] = true;
34:     }
35: }
```

#### Section 6 - Crafting Malicious Payload

Assume that the following data will be the payload passes to the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function.

```solidity
abi.encodeWithSignature(
    "relayMessage(address,address,bytes,uint256)",
    _target,
    _sender,
    _message,
    _messageNonce
);
```

The `_target` is set to `L1Bridge` address and the `_sender` is set to `L2Bridge` address. The `_message` will be set to as follows:

```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(
    this.finalizeBridgeETH.selector,
    _from,
    _to,
    _amount,
    _extraData
),
```

The `_to` is set to the attacker's wallet and `_amount` is set to a sufficiently large ETH amount that the L1 bridge is expected to hold.

#### Section 7 - Exploitation

Right before the migration start, the attacker can submit the malicious payload in the previous section to the `OVM_L2ToL1MessagePasser.passMessageToL1` function. When the migration starts, the attacker's legacy withdrawal will be migrated to the bedrock-style withdrawal, and the sender and target of the malicious withdrawal will be set to `&predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr` and `l1CrossDomainMessenger` respectively.

After the migration, the attacker can call the prove the malicious withdrawal via the `OptimismPortal.proveWithdrawalTransaction`. Since the malicious withdrawal has already been inserted into the storage of Bedrock's `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract during the migration process (Refer to Section 4), the attacker will have no issue proving the malicious withdrawal.

After the 7-day waiting period, the attacker can call the `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` to finalize the withdrawal, and the Optimism Portal will call the `L1CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` function to relay the message within the withdrawal. The `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will in turn call the `L1StandardBridge.finalizeBridgeETH` function to finalize the ETH bridging, and the ETH will be forwarded to the attacker's address.

At this point, the attacker successfully steals ETH Optimism's L1 infrastructure. Note that the attacker could also drain any ERC20 tokens held by Optimism's L1 infrastructure by switching the selector within the malicious payload to `finalizeBridgeERC20` instead.

## Impact

The impact is High as it results in loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended only to migrate legacy withdrawals initiated by Legacy's L2CrossDomainMessenger.

Update the `ToWithdrawals` function to only process legacy withdrawals initiated by Legacy's L2CrossDomainMessenger.

```diff
func (m *MigrationData) ToWithdrawals() ([]*crossdomain.LegacyWithdrawal, error) {
	messages := make([]*crossdomain.LegacyWithdrawal, 0)
-	for _, msg := range m.OvmMessages {
+	for who, msg := range m.OvmMessages {
+		if who != predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr {
+			continue // skip if the message is not initated by L2CrossDomainMessenger
+		}
		wd, err := msg.ToLegacyWithdrawal()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		messages = append(messages, wd)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
	}
-	for _, msg := range m.EvmMessages {
+	for who, msg := range m.EvmMessages {
+		if who != predeploys.L2CrossDomainMessengerAddr {
+			continue // skip if the message is not initated by L2CrossDomainMessenger
+		}
		wd, err := msg.ToLegacyWithdrawal()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		messages = append(messages, wd)
	}
	return messages, nil
}
```
