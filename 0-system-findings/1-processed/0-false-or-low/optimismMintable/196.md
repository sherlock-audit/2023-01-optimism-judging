# EIP-681 may not be supported by all NFT marketplaces. Opensea is looking to support but may not be supported yet.

## Summary
EIP-681 may not be supported by all NFT marketplaces. Opensea is looking to support but may not be supported yet.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Kartik (@Slokh), Head of Protocol, Opensea](https://twitter.com/Slokh) said that "We're also looking to support EIP-681 for `tokenURI`. This will allow NFTs bridged to L2s to reference the corresponding `tokenURI` on L1 as the source of truth." on January 6, 2023.

This means that Opensea hasn't supported EIP-681 yet but is looking to support it.

Other NFT marketplaces haven't announced EIP-681 support yet.

EIP-681 isn't a famous standard despite the fact that it is on the standard track. That's the reason NFT marketplaces are not supported yet.

## Impact

Bridged NFT will shows as blank image without any metadata on NFT marketplaces.
