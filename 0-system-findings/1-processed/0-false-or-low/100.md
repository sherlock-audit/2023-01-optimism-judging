Severity: False
Reason: Non standard ERC20 implementations can cause problems and cause the tokens to get stuck in the cross domain messenger. This indeed is a problem, but I don’t think its our problem because the cross domain messenger shouldn’t need to know what kind of calls it is making, it should just make calls.
    Also, ERC20 tokens should use the StandardBridge for bridging, there is no reason for the Messengers to hold tokens.

# ERC20s that return false on transfer instead of reverting will get stuck in bridge

## Summary

While most ERC20s correctly implement the spec, there are a number of ERC20s (notably including ZRX) that return `false` when a transfer fails, rather than reverting. Because of the CrossDomainMessenger's error handling, these failed transfers will not be replayable, and tokens will get permanently stuck in the bridge.

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC20 token transfers are supposed to return `true` on success and revert in the case of failure. However, some notable ERC20s do not implement the spec properly. Some, like BNB, do not return `true`, while others, like ZRX, do not revert.

Here is the relevant code from ZRX:
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    } else { return false; }
}
```
This token returns false in the event of a failed transfer, rather than reverting. While this doesn't implement the spec properly, it should be respected, as the return of `false` directly violates the ERC20 spec's requirement to return `true` in the event of a successful transfer.

The error handling in `CrossDomainMessenger` does not take return values into account. It simply looks at whether the transaction reverted or not to decide whether or not to mark the transaction as failed (and thus replayable):
```solidity
xDomainMsgSender = _sender;
bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_GAS_BUFFER, _value, _message);
xDomainMsgSender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;

if (success == true) {
    successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
    emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
} else {
    failedMessages[versionedHash] = true;
    emit FailedRelayedMessage(versionedHash);
}
```
The result is that, for any token that returns `false` rather than reverting, the `bool success` return value will be set to true, and the transaction will be considered successful.

## Impact

Users bridging tokens that are seen as normal ERC20s (although they do not perfectly implement the spec) will have the potential to have their tokens permanently stuck in the bridge.

## Recommendation

Any fix to this issue would require a pretty substantial change to the logic of the bridge, and would introduce further security risks (including returndata bombs).

My recommendation is just to explicitly enumerate in the documentation the types of tokens that are safe to use on the Standard Bridge and the facts a user should check about a token before bridging.
