# Bad RPC provider data can (and did) take down sequencer

## Summary

Batchers retrieve the suggested gas tip from the RPC provider by calling `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas`, but if RPC returns a nil value, the resulting panic error can take down the Sequencer. This, in fact, happened during the contest.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the batcher puts together a new block, it follows the following process:
- The `loop()` function creates new L2 blocks by loading in and sending transactions.
- For each tx, it calls `SendTransaction()` which calls `CraftTx()` to put together the full transaction data (chain ID, nonce, gas, etc).
- At one point, `CraftTx()` calls `calcGasTipAndFeeCap()`, which queries the RPC provider by calling  `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas`. This information is used to fill the `GasTipCap` field of the transaction.

However, the `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` method is not supported by all RPC providers, and can therefore return `nil`.

If this happens, then when `gasTipCap` is passed to following function, it will panic:

```go
gasFeeCap = txmgr.CalcGasFeeCap(head.BaseFee, gasTipCap)
```

```go
func CalcGasFeeCap(baseFee, gasTipCap *big.Int) *big.Int {
	return new(big.Int).Add(
		gasTipCap,
		new(big.Int).Mul(baseFee, big.NewInt(2)),
	)
}
```
The unhandled panic in `CalcGasFeeCap` will take down the Sequencer.

## Impact

If the Sequencer tries to create a transaction and pings an RPC endpoint that doesn't support `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` (or is temporarily unable to return a valid value), the Sequencer will panic and be taken down.

This happened on Jan 25 and took down the Goerli Sequencer for over 3 hours.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We see that the fix performed by the Optimism team on Jan 25th was to add a check in `calcGasTipAndFeeCap()` to ensure that `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` returns a non-nil value. Otherwise, use a default value.

We would like to note that this is solving only one instance of the dangerous pattern that exists in `SuggestGasTipCap()` (as well as `SuggestGasPrice()`, which follows the same pattern). 

In both of these functions, when values are returned from the RPC, if a `nil` value is returned without an error, we will end up with a return value of `nil, nil` and this will not be caught by the current error checking.

Assuming you don't want to add more code to the diff for `op-geth`, consider doing a careful review of all places in `op-node` where these two functions are referenced, and adding a similar check to ensure `nil` return values are caught.
