# Use safetransferfrom instead of transferfrom for ERC721 transfers

## Summary

Using ERC721 unsafe transferFrom will cause some NFT loss if the recipient can't accept ERC721 and won't execute onERC721Received in the recipient contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom(), which I assume is a gas-saving measure. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

- [OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of transferFrom(); use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible
- The recipient could have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom(). A notable example of such contracts is the Sudoswap pair:
```solidity
function onERC721Received(
  address,
  address,
  uint256 id,
  bytes memory
) public virtual returns (bytes4) {
  IERC721 _nft = nft();
  // If it's from the pair's NFT, add the ID to ID set
  if (msg.sender == address(_nft)) {
    idSet.add(id);
  }
  return this.onERC721Received.selector;
}
```
- It helps ensure that the recipient is indeed capable of handling ERC721s.

## Impact

While unlikely because the recipient is the contract, there is the potential loss of NFTs should the contract be unable to handle the sent ERC721s.
