  - **Description:** `getL2OutputIndexAfter` can return a incorrect index
  - **Reason:** This report is false. The `getL2OutputIndexAfter` function reverts if the provided l2 block number is greater than the latest block number within the `L2OutputOracle`'s `l2Outputs` array. The intended behavior of the function is that, for all inputs <= the latest block number in the `l2Outputs` array, the nearest index corresponding to a block number *after or at* the input block number will be returned. This is because the goal of the function is to find the "index of the first checkpoint that **commits** to the given L2 block number."

# `getL2OutputIndexAfter` can return a incorrect index

## Summary
The function [`getL2OutputIndexAfter`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L236-L262) can return a index that does not correspond to the paramater `_l2BlockNumber`

## Vulnerability Detail
As said in [L2OutputOracle.sol#L228-L235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L228-L235) the function [`getL2OutputIndexAfter`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L236-L262) Returns the index of the L2 output that checkpoints a given L2 block number however if the inputted  parameter `_l2BlockNumber` does not exist it will still return a index making it seem like the value of `_l2BlockNumber` exist even though the index of the array will not correspond to the value of `_l2BlockNumber`
## Impact

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function getL2OutputIndexAfter(uint256 _l2BlockNumber) public view returns (uint256) {
        // Make sure an output for this block number has actually been proposed.
        require(
            _l2BlockNumber <= latestBlockNumber(),
            "L2OutputOracle: cannot get output for a block that has not been proposed"
        );


        // Make sure there's at least one output proposed.
        require(
            l2Outputs.length > 0,
            "L2OutputOracle: cannot get output as no outputs have been proposed yet"
        );


        // Find the output via binary search, guaranteed to exist.
        uint256 lo = 0;
        uint256 hi = l2Outputs.length;
        while (lo < hi) {
            uint256 mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (l2Outputs[mid].l2BlockNumber < _l2BlockNumber) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }


        return lo;
    }
