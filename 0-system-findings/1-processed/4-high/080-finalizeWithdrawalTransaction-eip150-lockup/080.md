# `relayMessage` may call the target functions with less gas than was anticipated by its sender

## Summary
The `relayMessage` inside `CrossDomainMessenger` does not check the `minGasLimit` specified by the user correctly and can call the function with less gas than specified by the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
Security check for `_minGasLimit` inside the `relaymessage()` inside the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract is implemented such as:
```solidity
require(
            gasleft() >= _minGasLimit + RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED,
            "CrossDomainMessenger: insufficient gas to relay message"
        );
```
However, while the `baseGas` used by the `sendMessage` function does calculate the 1/64 of the gas that is reserved through internal calls according to [EIP-150](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md), is not considered by the implemented security check by `relayMessage`. It should be mentioned that the user has to pay for it on the other chain, where `baseGas` calculates this amount.

## Impact
While a user can provide the correct amount of `_minGasLimit` to the protocol, the target function can be called with less gas and can fail by running out of gas. The transaction should then be replayed later with a greater gas value as it gets stored in `failedMessages`.

This issue is highlighted when the amount of `_minGasLimit` is increased. If it is more than `RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED * 64 = 45000 * 64 = 2880000`, the problem will show itself. In the below PoC, target function is called with more than 6000 gas less than `_minGasLimit`, this problem increases with the amount of `_minGasLimit`.

    constructor (uint256 _minGas) {
        minGas = _minGas;
    }
    function targetFunction() public returns(uint256 gasLeft){
        gasLeft = gasleft();
        console.log(gasLeft); // 2993969, it is less than 3000000 specified for the function call!
        return gasLeft;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The mitigation is as easy as checking the amount of `gasleft()` to be more than 64/63 of the current checked value for `_minGasLimit`:
```solidity
@@ -315,15 +317,22
         require(
-            gasleft() >= _minGasLimit + RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED,
+            gasleft() >= ((_minGasLimit) * 64 / 63) + RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED,
```
Where the final check should look like:
```solidity
        require(
            gasleft() >= ((_minGasLimit) * 64 / 63) + RELAY_GAS_REQUIRED,
            "CrossDomainMessenger: insufficient gas to relay message"
        );
```
