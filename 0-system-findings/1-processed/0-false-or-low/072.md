# legacy withdrawal status is never updated

## Summary
It was observed that `successfulMessages[oldHash]` is never updated even when relay was success. This causes confusion for the backend scripts which rely on `successfulMessages[oldHash]` to obtain pending withdrawals

## Vulnerability Detail
1. A message with Version 0 (legacy) is relayed using `relayMessage` function
2. It is checked whether this message has already been withdrawn using below check

```solidity
if (version == 0) {
            bytes32 oldHash = Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessageV0(_target, _sender, _message, _nonce);
            require(
                successfulMessages[oldHash] == false,
                "CrossDomainMessenger: legacy withdrawal already relayed"
            );
        }
```

3. Once the relay is complete observe `successfulMessages[oldHash]` is not updated and only hash with newer version is updated

```solidity
if (success == true) {
            successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
            emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
        }
```

## Impact
The leagcy withdrawal status will mark withdrawn message as unwithdrawn. This becomes a problem when backend Go code is collecting all `GetPendingWithdrawals` for processing and obtains the processed withdrawals as well

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the success condition to also update legacy withdrawal status

```solidity
if (success == true) {
            successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
			if (version == 0) {
			successfulMessages[oldHash] = true;
			}
            emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
        }
```
