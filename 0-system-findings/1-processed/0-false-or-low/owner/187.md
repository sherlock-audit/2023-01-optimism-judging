# Owner can renounce ownership

## Summary
Typically, the contractâ€™s owner is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the owner is able to perform certain privileged activities.

## Vulnerability Detail
The non-fungible OwnableUpgradeable and Ownable used in several project contracts inherit/implement `renounceOwnership()`. This can represent a certain risk if the ownership is renounced for any other reason than by design. 

## Impact
Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider re-implementing the function to disable it or clearly specifying if it is part of the contract design.
