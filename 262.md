# Different solidity versions observed in smart contract

## Summary

Most of the contracts are using the pragma version of 0.8.15. But some of the contracts are using 0.8.0, and 0.6.0

Example :

CrossDomainOwnable.sol = 0.8.0
CrossDomainOwnable2.sol = 0.8.0
oracle.sol = 0.6.0

other contracts are using 0.8.15

There could be possibilities that any vulnerability can be found in any of the version which is used in future which could cause any of the contracts.

in worst case , if all the versions found with bugs, then the protocol would suffer from multiple direction.

The amount of work involved to fix them also increase.
