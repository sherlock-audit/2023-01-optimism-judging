# `withdrawals.ProveWithdrawalParameters()` returns an incorrect withdrawal proof

## Summary
The `withdrawals.ProveWithdrawalParameters()` returns an incorrect withdrawal proof because the `withdrawalHash` is read at an incorrect stroage slot. This will cause nodes to fail proving withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`op-node/withdrawals/utils.go`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/withdrawals/utils.go#L271) the function `StorageSlotOfWithdrawalHash` computes the storage key of `withdrawalHash` in the `L2toL1MessagePasser` contract as follows:

`keccak256(withdrawalHash || Bytes64(0x0))`

But it should be

`keccak256(withdrawalHash || Bytes32(0x0))`

This causes the storage to be read to be incorrect (probably 0x0) and the returned proof in `ProveWithdrawalParameters` to be incorrect as well.

## Impact
`ProveWithdrawalParameters` is used for testing the withdrawal flow and can lead to flawed tests.
Moreover, while the folder op-node is in scope, this should not be an issue at the current time, but it can become one if used in other functions in the future.

## Recommendation

```go

    func StorageSlotOfWithdrawalHash(hash common.Hash) common.Hash {
        // The withdrawals mapping is the second (0 indexed) storage element in the Withdrawer contract.
        // To determine the storage slot, use keccak256(withdrawalHash ++ p)
        // Where p is the 32 byte value of the storage slot and ++ is concatenation
-       buf := make([]byte, 64)
+       buf := make([]byte, 32)
        copy(buf, hash[:])
        return crypto.Keccak256Hash(buf)
    }

```
