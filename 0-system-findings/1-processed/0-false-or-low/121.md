# Default decimals in OptimismMintableERC20 could lead to loss of funds

## Summary
In `OptimismMintableERC20Factory` contract is not possible to create a new `OptimismMintableERC20` with different decimals than 18.

## Vulnerability Detail
`OptimismMintableERC20Factory` is the contract maintained by Optimism responsible for creating new bridge-compatible ERC20s on L2 after users have deposited their tokens in L1.

The vulnerability appears when trying to bridge L1 tokens that have a different number of decimals than 18, here is the PoC:

1. Alice wants to send her token A with 8 decimals from L1 to L2, so she decides to create a new token in L2 by using the `OptmismMintableERC20Factory` and calling `createOptmismMintableERC20`
```solidity
function createOptimismMintableERC20(
  address _remoteToken,
  string memory _name,
  string memory _symbol
) public returns (address) {
  require(
    _remoteToken != address(0),
    "OptimismMintableERC20Factory: must provide remote token address"
  );

  address localToken = address(
    new OptimismMintableERC20(BRIDGE, _remoteToken, _name, _symbol)
  );

  // Emit the old event too for legacy support.
  emit StandardL2TokenCreated(_remoteToken, localToken);

  // Emit the updated event. The arguments here differ from the legacy event, but
  // are consistent with the ordering used in StandardBridge events.
  emit OptimismMintableERC20Created(localToken, _remoteToken, msg.sender);

  return localToken;
}
```

2. After she executes this function, a similar token A is created but in L2
3. Alice didn't notice the number of decimals from the L2 token is 18 decimals
4. Alice sends 1 Token A ( 1 * (10ˆ8) ) from L1 to L2
5. When she or any other contract checks the number of tokens Alice will have a different value considering 18 decimals
    1. 1 Token A L1 ⇒ 0.0000000001 Token A L2

The impact here is related to compatibility; if Alice uses another DeFi project on L2 it will read a different number of decimals 18 from the ones specified on the L1 token 8 and could make Alice lose some tokens or deal with some mistakes.

## Impact
Possibility of loss of funds from users that send tokens with different decimals and could lead to amount mistakes using these bridge tokens on Defi

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add the possibility of specifying the number of decimals when creating a new `OptimismMintableERC20`

```diff
function createOptimismMintableERC20(
  address _remoteToken,
  string memory _name,
+ uint8 _decimals,
	string memory _symbol
) public returns (address) {
  require(
    _remoteToken != address(0),
    "OptimismMintableERC20Factory: must provide remote token address"
  );
+ require(_decimals != 0, "OptimismMintableERC20Factory: wrong decimals");
  address localToken = address(
-   new OptimismMintableERC20(BRIDGE, _remoteToken, _name, _symbol)
+   new OptimismMintableERC20(BRIDGE, _remoteToken, _name, _symbol, _decimals)
  );

  // Emit the old event too for legacy support.
  emit StandardL2TokenCreated(_remoteToken, localToken);

  // Emit the updated event. The arguments here differ from the legacy event, but
  // are consistent with the ordering used in StandardBridge events.
  emit OptimismMintableERC20Created(localToken, _remoteToken, msg.sender);

  return localToken;
}
```
