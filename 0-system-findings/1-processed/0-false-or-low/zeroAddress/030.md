# Zero address check in the StandardBridge._initiateBridgeETH() function

## Summary
`StandardBridge` allows ETH to be sent to the zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail.
The `StandardBridge._initiateBridgeETH()` function does not check `_to != address(0)`.

## Impact
This can lead to a loss of ETH and bad UX.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L347-L383

## Tool used
Manual Review, VSCodium

## Recommendation
Add a check to the function.

/**

 * @param _to          Address of the receiver.
 * @param _amount      Amount of ETH being bridged.
 * @param _minGasLimit Minimum amount of gas that the bridge can be relayed with.
 * @param _extraData   Extra data to be sent with the transaction. Note that the recipient will

 *                     to identify the transaction.
