# Fee on transfer/deflationary tokens are not correctly handled by L1StandardBridge.sol

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens implement fee on transfer functionality (such as STA, PAXG) as seen on https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20. Some more popular tokens such as USDC and USDT may use non-zero fees in the future.
Fee on transfer tokens are not correctly handled by L1StandardBridge, since the amount which may be received upon transfer by the bridge may be less than `_amount`.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Since the bridge allows to mint exactly `_amount` of tokens on L2, and then redeem for exactly `_amount` of tokens on L1, there may be less funds escrowed on the L1 contract than allowed to redeem, which may cause some withdrawals to fail.

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In StandardBridge.sol:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L414-L415

```solidity
uint balanceBefore = IERC20(_localToken).balance(address(this));
IERC20(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
uint balanceAfter = IERC20(_localToken).balance(address(this));

deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] + balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
