# Delayed checks could lead to loss of funds

## Summary
Few checks are performed after User has sent a transaction from L1-L2. If these checks fail then transaction cannot proceed and fund are stuck

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Lets say User A bridges local token A to remote token B using [bridgeERC20To](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L265)

2. This eventually is executed on L2 in `finalizeBridgeERC20` function 

```solidity
function finalizeBridgeERC20(
        address _localToken,
        address _remoteToken,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) public onlyOtherBridge {
        if (_isOptimismMintableERC20(_localToken)) {
            require(
                _isCorrectTokenPair(_localToken, _remoteToken),
                "StandardBridge: wrong remote token for Optimism Mintable ERC20 local token"
            );
			...
			}
```

3. Lets say User mistakenly provided incorrect token pair B for A then require condition fails and transaction cannot process, thus funds are stuck

4. If the same checks were performed in L1 then this fund loss could have been prevented

## Impact
User will lose funds which were associated with the message

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The checks should be peformed on the layer sending messages as well. This will prevent users from sending incorrect message and hence prevent there funds
