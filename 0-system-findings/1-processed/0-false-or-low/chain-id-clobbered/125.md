  - **Reason:** The chain ID is indeed being clobbered by the payloadBytes. DDoS risk is low, however, so this is more of a low than a medium.

# p2p signatures are not unique per chain

## Summary

Signed L2 blocks can be gossiped on the p2p network for any chain. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Signed L2 blocks are meant to use the L2 Chain ID to create p2p signatures unique to each chain.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/rollup/types.go#L44-L45

However, the actual signing code clobbers the chain ID section with the payload hash

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/op-node/p2p/signer.go#L26-L39

`msgInput[32:64]` is filled with the chain ID and then immediately overwritten. The intended behavior is described in a comment on line 35.

## Impact

Blocks signed for one chain id can be injected into the p2p pool on another, where nodes will ingest and attempt to append them to the chain. This will generally fail due to block number or parent root hash mismatch, but causes unnecessary network load and is a DoS vector.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fix the `SigningHash` function such that the payload hash is placed into the third 32 bytes of `msgInput`.
