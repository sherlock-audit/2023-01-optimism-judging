# Inconsistency In Immutable Configuration

## Summary

Some inconsistencies were found between the configuration in the `immutables.go` and the actual immutable variables that need to be initializated, which might lead to unexpected result during the migration and deployment processes.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some inconsistencies were found between the configuration in the `immutables.go` and the actual immutable variables that need to be initializated.

#### Instance 1 - `L2StandardBridge`

The `L2StandardBridge`  immutable config missed out on the `MESSENGER` in the `StandardBridge` contract.

```go
File: immutables.go
47: 		{
48: 			Name: "L2StandardBridge",
49: 			Args: []interface{}{
50: 				immutable["L2StandardBridge"]["otherBridge"],
51: 			},
52: 		},
```
```solidity
File: StandardBridge.sol
20: abstract contract StandardBridge {
21:     using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
22: 
23:     /**
24:      * @notice The L2 gas limit set when eth is depoisited using the receive() function.
25:      */
26:     uint32 internal constant RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT = 200_000;
27: 
28:     /**
29:      * @notice Messenger contract on this domain.
30:      */
31:     CrossDomainMessenger public immutable MESSENGER;
32: 
33:     /**

## Impact

Inconsistencies between the configuration in the `immutables.go` and the actual immutable variables that need to be initializated might cause unexpected result during the migration and deployment processes.
