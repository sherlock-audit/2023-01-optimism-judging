Severity: False
Reasoning: There is test coverage of these values being configured correctly in [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/tasks/check-l2.ts](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/tasks/check-l2.ts). This script was ran against goerli and the test migrations to ensure that the configuration was correct.

The immutables mentioned in the document describe immutables that have hardcoded values in their constructors. This would mean that it is not necessary to set these values manually. If you follow the codepath [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-chain-ops/immutables/immutables.go#L67), you can see that all of the immutable values that are dynamic at deploy time as constructor args are present.

You can see an example [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/8db72309c9c651b1ac7950b0ad4e4a9876f304a7/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/legacy/LegacyERC20ETH.sol#L22) of an instance in which the values for an immutable are hardcoded in the bytecode itself.

The `OptimismMintableTokenFactory` hardcodes the deploy arg instead of having it be in the immutable config to reduce config, see this line [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/8db72309c9c651b1ac7950b0ad4e4a9876f304a7/op-chain-ops/immutables/immutables.go#L203).

Action: The code should be cleaner (better consistency as some args are hardcoded outside of immutable config, some are hardcoded in immutable config, some are dynamic) and better documented so its not possible to make this kind of mistake. There indeed is no real issue here and we have test coverage around this if there was an issue. I think the solution here is to document the code better.

# Inconsistency In Immutable Configuration

## Summary

Some inconsistencies were found between the configuration in the `immutables.go` and the actual immutable variables that need to be initializated, which might lead to unexpected result during the migration and deployment processes.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some inconsistencies were found between the configuration in the `immutables.go` and the actual immutable variables that need to be initializated.

#### Instance 1 - `L2StandardBridge`

The `L2StandardBridge`  immutable config missed out on the `MESSENGER` in the `StandardBridge` contract.

```go

51: 			},
52: 		},
```
```solidity
File: StandardBridge.sol
20: abstract contract StandardBridge {
21:     using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

Inconsistencies between the configuration in the `immutables.go` and the actual immutable variables that need to be initializated might cause unexpected result during the migration and deployment processes.
