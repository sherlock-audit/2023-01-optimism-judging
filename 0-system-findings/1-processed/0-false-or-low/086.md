# After EIP-4758 SELFDESTRUCT opcode will be replaced

## Summary

The proposal EIP-4758 plans to deactivate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode

## Vulnerability Detail

According to EIP-4758, the proposal is to:

## Impact

After EIP-4758, the OpCodes.sol contract might not work as intended.

## Code Snippet

[OpCodes.sol#L301](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/optimism-history/tests/solidity/contracts/OpCodes.sol#L301)

assembly { selfdestruct(0x02) }
```
