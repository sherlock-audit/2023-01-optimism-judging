# When messenger is paused, all matured withdrawals can be forever invalidated

## Summary

In the Bedrock withdrawal implementation, withdrawals mature 7 days after submission. At this point they can be delivered using OptimismPortal's `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` by anyone, as long as they provide enough gas.

Using the Cross Domain Messenger guarantees replayability of transactions. However, if the L1CrossDomainMessenger is paused when `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` is called, the transaction will revert in a way that is non-replayable and the funds will be locked permanently.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Cross Domain Messenger's `relayMessage()` function has the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which will revert when paused. Since OptimismPortal has no replayability, the call will fail and the withdrawal would be lost forever.
```solidity
bool success = SafeCall.call(
    _tx.target,
    gasleft() - FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,
    _tx.value,
    _tx.data
);
// Reset the l2Sender back to the default value.
l2Sender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;
// All withdrawals are immediately finalized. Replayability can
// be achieved through contracts built on top of this contract
emit WithdrawalFinalized(withdrawalHash, success);
// Reverting here is useful for determining the exact gas cost to successfully execute the
// sub call to the target contract if the minimum gas limit specified by the user would not
// be sufficient to execute the sub call.
if (success == false && tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
    revert("OptimismPortal: withdrawal failed");
}
```

The impact is extremely severe, because `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` can be called by anyone. The moment the messenger is paused, a malicious user, such as an Optimism competitor, could finalize all matured withdrawals, leading to massive user losses.

For this reason, severity of High is definitely justified, whereas if `finalize` is only callable by user, Medium severity would be accurate.

## Impact

When the Cross Domain Messenger is paused, all matured withdrawals can be forever invalidated by any user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add protection logic in `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()`. If call target is the messenger and the messenger is paused, revert the transaction.
