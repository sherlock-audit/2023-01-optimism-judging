# FeeVault set 20K gas limit which can be not enough to bridge fee from L2 to L1

## Summary
FeeVault set 20K gas limit which can be not enough to bridge fee from L2 to L1.
## Vulnerability Detail
FeeVault.withdraw function bridges eth from L2 to L1 using L2StandardBridge and it sets [only 20K of gas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/FeeVault.sol#L67) as gas limit of transaction.
This can be not enough to finish tx on L1, so tx will be stored as failed inside CrossDomainMessanger contract. It will be possible to replay it with more gas provided, but that is inconvenient.

To compare we can look at receive function inside StandardBridge contract and we will see that by default it uses [200k of gas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L170) which is 10 times bigger than FeeVault.  
## Impact
Tx will fail and it will be needed to replay it with more gas provided.

## Recommendation
Use 200k instead of 20k.
