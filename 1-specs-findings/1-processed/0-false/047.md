# REQUIRE MESSAGES ARE TOO SHORT AND UNCLEAR

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The correct and clear error description explains to the user why the function reverts, but the error descriptions below in the project are not self-explanatory. These error descriptions are very important in the debug features of DApps like Tenderly. Error definitions should be added to the require block, not exceeding 32 bytes.
