# Missing free 1.92 million gas cause bridging gas costs to increase dramatically.

## Summary

Missing free 1.92 million gas cause bridging gas costs to increase dramatically.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#accessing-msg-sender

From Optimism's official document

### Fees for sending data from L1 â‡’ L2 transactions

An L1 to L2 message is expected to trigger contract execution on L2, and that contract execution costs gas. The first 1.92 million gas on L2 is free. The vast majority of L1 to L2 calls spend less than the 1.92 million, so nothing further is required.

If you think that your call might spend more than that on L2, you can specify a higher gas limit. However, to prevent denial of service attacks, we have to impose a cost on gas limits higher than 1.92 million. This cost is one unit of L1 gas for every 32 units of L2 gas requested beyond the free amount.

### Current Bedrock behavior

It calculates the amount of gas to be burned, no matter how less the gas limit is. This causes the gas price to be increased dramatically since there aren't free 1.92 million gas anymore.

This can be seen in code starting from the `depositTransaction` function in `OptimismPortal` that use `metered(_gasLimit)` modifier from the `ResourceMetering` abstract contract. Notice that `_gasLimit` is passed directly without any subtraction of free gas.

```solidity
     function depositTransaction( 
         address _to, 
         uint256 _value, 
         uint64 _gasLimit, 
         bool _isCreation, 
         bytes memory _data 
     ) public payable metered(_gasLimit) { 
```

In the `metered` modifier, `_amount` which is `_gasLimit` passed from `depositTransaction` function without any subtraction of free gas, is used to compute `resourceCost`, which is then used to compute `gasCost` that is the gas cost that will be burned.

```solidity
    modifier metered(uint64 _amount) {
        // Record initial gas amount so we can refund for it later.
        uint256 initialGas = gasleft();

        // Run the underlying function.
        _;

       ... CALCULATE params ...

        // Make sure we can actually buy the resource amount requested by the user.
        params.prevBoughtGas += _amount;
        require(
            int256(uint256(params.prevBoughtGas)) <= MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT,
            "ResourceMetering: cannot buy more gas than available gas limit"
        );

        // Determine the amount of ETH to be paid.
        uint256 resourceCost = _amount * params.prevBaseFee;

        // We currently charge for this ETH amount as an L1 gas burn, so we convert the ETH amount
        // into gas by dividing by the L1 base fee. We assume a minimum base fee of 1 gwei to avoid
        // division by zero for L1s that don't support 1559 or to avoid excessive gas burns during
        // periods of extremely low L1 demand. One-day average gas fee hasn't dipped below 1 gwei
        // during any 1 day period in the last 5 years, so should be fine.
        uint256 gasCost = resourceCost / Math.max(block.basefee, 1000000000);

        // Give the user a refund based on the amount of gas they used to do all of the work up to
        // this point. Since we're at the end of the modifier, this should be pretty accurate. Acts
        // effectively like a dynamic stipend (with a minimum value).
        uint256 usedGas = initialGas - gasleft();
        if (gasCost > usedGas) {
            Burn.gas(gasCost - usedGas);
        }
    }
```

So, burned gas is calculated from full `_gasLimit` without any subtraction of free gas.

### Old Optimism behavior

Before starting the gas-burning mechanism, it will test `if (_gasLimit > enqueueL2GasPrepaid)`. If `_gasLimit` doesn't exceed `enqueueL2GasPrepaid`, it won't burn any gas. `enqueueL2GasPrepaid` represents 1.92 million free gas.

```solidity
        // Transactions submitted to the queue lack a method for paying gas fees to the Sequencer.
        // So we need to prevent spam attacks by ensuring that the cost of enqueueing a transaction
        // from L1 to L2 is not underpriced. For transaction with a high L2 gas limit, we do this by
        // burning some extra gas on L1. Of course there is also some intrinsic cost to enqueueing a
        // transaction, so we want to make sure not to over-charge (by burning too much L1 gas).
        // Therefore, we define 'enqueueL2GasPrepaid' as the L2 gas limit above which we must burn
        // additional gas on L1. This threshold is the product of two inputs:
        // 1. enqueueGasCost: the base cost of calling this function.
        // 2. l2GasDiscountDivisor: the ratio between the cost of gas on L1 and L2. This is a
        //    positive integer, meaning we assume L2 gas is always less costly.
        // The calculation below for gasToConsume can be seen as converting the difference (between
        // the specified L2 gas limit and the prepaid L2 gas limit) to an L1 gas amount.
        if (_gasLimit > enqueueL2GasPrepaid) {
            uint256 gasToConsume = (_gasLimit - enqueueL2GasPrepaid) / l2GasDiscountDivisor;
            uint256 startingGas = gasleft();

            // Although this check is not necessary (burn below will run out of gas if not true), it
            // gives the user an explicit reason as to why the enqueue attempt failed.
            require(startingGas > gasToConsume, "Insufficient gas for L2 rate limiting burn.");

            uint256 i;
            while (startingGas - gasleft() < gasToConsume) {
                i++;
            }
        }
```

## Impact

If that dApps use, for example, 1.5 million gas. The user of that dApp will see a dramatic increase in gas fees while bridging to Optimism. This impacts the volume of dApps and indirectly causes them to lose their revenue.

- Reading Optimism's official document
- Compare new code with old code

## Recommendation

Pass `enqueueL2GasPrepaid` to the `metered` modifier and deduct that amount from `_amount` before calculating gas burning.

```solidity
    modifier metered(uint64 _amount, uint64 _enqueueL2GasPrepaid) {
        // Record initial gas amount so we can refund for it later.
        uint256 initialGas = gasleft();

        // Run the underlying function.
        _;

        if (_amount > _enqueueL2GasPrepaid) {

        _amount = _amount - _enqueueL2GasPrepaid;

       ... CALCULATE params ...

        // Make sure we can actually buy the resource amount requested by the user.
        params.prevBoughtGas += _amount;
        require(
            int256(uint256(params.prevBoughtGas)) <= MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT,
            "ResourceMetering: cannot buy more gas than available gas limit"
        );

        // Determine the amount of ETH to be paid.
        uint256 resourceCost = _amount * params.prevBaseFee;

        // We currently charge for this ETH amount as an L1 gas burn, so we convert the ETH amount
        // into gas by dividing by the L1 base fee. We assume a minimum base fee of 1 gwei to avoid
        // division by zero for L1s that don't support 1559 or to avoid excessive gas burns during
        // periods of extremely low L1 demand. One-day average gas fee hasn't dipped below 1 gwei
        // during any 1 day period in the last 5 years, so should be fine.
        uint256 gasCost = resourceCost / Math.max(block.basefee, 1000000000);

        // Give the user a refund based on the amount of gas they used to do all of the work up to
        // this point. Since we're at the end of the modifier, this should be pretty accurate. Acts
        // effectively like a dynamic stipend (with a minimum value).
        uint256 usedGas = initialGas - gasleft();
        if (gasCost > usedGas) {
            Burn.gas(gasCost - usedGas);
        }

        }
    }
