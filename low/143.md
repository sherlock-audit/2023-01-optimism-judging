# safeMint and safeTransfer means some contracts may be unable to receive tokens

## Summary

## Contract cannot receive due to safeTransfer
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L68-L69

## Vulnerability Detail

Because of the usage of `safeTransfer` any contract that doesn't extend `IERC721Receiver` will not be able to receive tokens bridged.


## Impact

For contracts that are ported from L1, that may not implement `onERC721Received`, the tokens would be unclaimable and stuck in the bridge.

In lack of a way to recover ERC721, or undo the briding TX, these tokens will be permanently lost

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove `safeTransfer` or document that every Smart Contract must extend `IERC721Receiver`
