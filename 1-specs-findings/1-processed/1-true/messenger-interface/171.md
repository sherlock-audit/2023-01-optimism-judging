# messengers: incorrect function name for `CrossDomainMessenger::OTHER_MESSENGER`


## Summary

The interface of `CrossDomainMessenger` in the specs has the function `otherMessenger`, which the `CrossDomainMessenger` does not expose.
The `CrossDomainMessenger` has `OTHER_MESSENGER` public variable, but whoever tries to call with the given `otherMessenger` signature will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/specs/messengers.md?plain=1#L38

The function `otherMessenger` should be `OTHER_MESSENGER` as there is no function or public variable named `otherMessenger`

## Impact

factually incorrect information (incorrect function name)

As the function name was given as a part of interface to the `CrossDomainMessenger`, anybody who is copying the interface and calls on the `otherMessenger` will revert.
