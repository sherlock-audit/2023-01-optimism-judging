# It would be great if you allow withdraw of FeeVault to L2 without bridging to L1

## Summary
It would be great if you allow withdraw of FeeVault to L2 without bridging to L1

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, FeeVault can only withdraw to L1 by using L2StandardBridge.bridgeETHTo which is time consuming if you just want to use it in your Optimism ecosystems.

## Impact
There may be some use case that you want your fee to be used in L2 Optimism ecosystems. Without withdrawal to L2 function, you need to withdraw to L1 and bridge back with is time consuming and costly.

## Code Snippet

## Recommendation
