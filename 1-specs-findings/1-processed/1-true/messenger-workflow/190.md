# Spec incorrectly describes how to finalize a withdrawal on L1

## Summary

The messangers spec incorrectly describes how `to finalize the withdrawal`. It writes that `relayMessage` needs to be called after the finalization window has passed when in practice `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` needs to be called in `OptimismPortal` to execute the withdrawal on L1
 
## Vulnerability Detail

The spec writes: 
```markdown
When going from L2 into L1, the user must call `relayMessage` on the
`L1CrossDomainMessenger` to finalize the withdrawal. This function can only
be called after the finalization window has passed.
```

The above describes is not how the implementation finalizes withdrawals

## Impact

Confusion, incorrect.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Explain that `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` needs to be called in `OptimismPortal` instead. Can also mention the replaying on failed messages feature.
