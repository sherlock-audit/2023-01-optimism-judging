# All the addresses by default are ERC1967

## Summary

The first member of Enum is zero, and a mapping referring to the Enum will always return zero for any keys by default. This means that for any given key in the mapping, the first member of Enum is the returned as value. If the first member of Enum is something meaningful, it can lead to confusion and wrong conclusion. Most probably, it will revert without any meaningful reason.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Enum `ProxyType` has three members `ERC1967`, `CHUGSPLASH`, and `RESOLVED`:
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol#L43-L47

The mapping `proxyType` hold the proxy type of each address.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol#L52

The function `setProxyType` sets the proxy type for a given address.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol#L86-L88

All in all, it means that any given address that its proxy type is not already set through `setProxyType` will have `proxyType[any arbitrary address] = 0`. The value `0` refers to the first member of Enum `ProxyType`, so any arbitrary address has by default the type `ERC1967`. 

So, when the function `getProxyImplementation` is called for a given address, by default it is `ProxyType.ERC1967`. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol#L153

Then the body of the first `if clause` will be executed, and if the given address is not implementing the relevant functions of `ERC1967`, the call will be reverted without any helpful reason.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol#L176

The same scenario can happen for the function `getProxyAdmin`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/ProxyAdmin.sol#L173

## Impact
There will be confusion when the functions `getProxyImplementation` or `getProxyAdmin` are called. Because, all addresses are by default `ProxyType.ERC1967`, and if they are not implementing the related functions of `ERC1967`, it will be reverted without any helpful reason.
## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**Solution One:**
It is recommended to add another member `None` to the Enum `ProxyType`:
```solidity
    enum ProxyType {
        None,
        ERC1967,
        CHUGSPLASH,
        RESOLVED
    }
```
**Solution Two:**
If the number of proxies is a lot so it is not possible to set type of all of them to `ERC1967`. So, it is better to have the following code, in which we check that if the staticcall is successful (it is an EOA or an `ERC1967` compatible contract), then we check the return data (if the length of return data is 32, it means that it is not an EOA). Otherwise, it is not an `ERC1967` compatible contract.
```solidity
    function getProxyImplementation(address _proxy)
        external
        view
        returns (address)
    {
        ProxyType ptype = proxyType[_proxy];
        if (ptype == ProxyType.ERC1967) {
            (bool success, bytes memory data) = _proxy.staticcall(
                abi.encodeWithSelector(
                    IStaticERC1967Proxy.implementation.selector
                )
            );
            if (success && data.length == 32) {
                address _address = abi.decode(data, (address));
                return _address;
            } else {
                revert("ProxyAdmin: unknown proxy type");
            }
        } else if (ptype == ProxyType.CHUGSPLASH) {
            return IStaticL1ChugSplashProxy(_proxy).getImplementation();
        } else if (ptype == ProxyType.RESOLVED) {
            return addressManager.getAddress(implementationName[_proxy]);
        } else {
            revert("ProxyAdmin: unknown proxy type");
        }
    }
```
