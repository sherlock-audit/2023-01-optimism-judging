  - **Description:** Max fee increase invariant is not respected in ResourceMetering.sol
  - **Reason:** The base fee increases by 1/8 the difference as specified in the aforementioned test case. Decreasing the elasticity as suggested would deviate significantly from the current implementation and overall reduce the security provided by the fee market to react quickly to demand (ie elasticity).

# Max fee increase invariant is not respected in ResourceMetering.sol

## Summary
Max fee increase invariant is not respected. As can be seen in `test_meter_useMax_succeeds`, when max resources are used, the fee increases by 3/8 instead of 1/8. Since the fuzzing test with echidna in `FuzzResourceMetering.sol` seems to make the correct check, I suspect the condition `(uint256(params.prevBlockNum) - cachedPrevBlockNum == 1)` to never be true, failing to set `failedMaxRaiseBaseFeePerBlock` to true.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Fee grows faster than expected, and decreases slower than it grows.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adjust as follows:

in ResourceMetering.sol:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L93-L96

Please either change ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER to 2, as in the original proposal: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#gasprice

or adapt in the following way:

```solidity
// Handle updating EIP-1559 style gas parameters. We use EIP-1559 to restrict the rate
// at which deposits can be created and therefore limit the potential for deposits to
// spam the L2 system. Fee scheme is very similar to EIP-1559 with minor changes.
int256 gasUsedDelta = int256(uint256(params.prevBoughtGas)) - TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT;
int256 baseFeeDelta = (int256(uint256(params.prevBaseFee)) * gasUsedDelta) /
    (MAX_RESOURCE_LIMIT - TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT) /
    BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR;
```
So the TARGET_RESOURCE_LIMIT remains unchanged, but max increase of the fee is indeed 1/8 (max decrease becomes 1/24).
