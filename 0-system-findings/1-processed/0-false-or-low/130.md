# Missing Check of Execution Success on the Other Chain

## Summary

The bridge contract relies on the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract to relay message between chains. However, the `sendMessage()` function does not check for the success of execution on the other chain, nor does the entire transaction reverts if the contract call on the other chain reverts. It is thus possible that a cross chain transaction executes successfully on one chain, but fails on the other chain. This could cause loss of user fund where a user locks tokens on one chain without receiving the corresponding asset on the other chain. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `StandardBridge` contract uses the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract to communicate with the other chain. The `sendMessage()` function does not return a `bool` variable to indicate whether the contract call on the other chain succeeds, nor does it revert on the current chain if the contract call on the other chain reverts. 

## Impact

Potential loss of user fund where user assets are locked on one chain but the user does not receive the corresponding asset on the other chain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend modifying the `sendMessage()` function to return a `bool` variable to indicate whether the execution is successful on the other chain. And check for the success or revert the entire transaction in the cross chain bridge contracts.
